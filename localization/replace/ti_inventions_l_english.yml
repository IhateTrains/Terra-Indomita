 xyston_inv_desc: "The xyston was a type of a long thrusting spear made of cornel wood in ancient Greece. It measured about 3.5 to 4.25 meters long and was probably held by the cavalryman with both hands, although some evidence suggests that it could also be used single handed. It had a wooden shaft and a spear-point at both ends. Possible reasons for the secondary spear-tip were that it acted partly as a counterweight and also served as a backup in case the xyston was broken in action. The xyston is usually mentioned in context with the hetairoi, the cavalry forces of ancient Macedon. After Alexander the Great's death, the hetairoi were named xystophoroi because of their use of the xyston lance."
 xiphos_inv_desc: "The xiphos was a double-edged, one-handed Iron Age straight shortsword used by the ancient Greeks.

 gladius_inv_desc: "This iconic Roman sword found its origins in Iberia. The Roman prototype was called the Gladius Hispaniensis (duh) but would be refined over time culminating in the Pompeii Gladius (because modern historians found it in the ruins of Pompeii). According to Polybius, this sword was used by the Roman army during the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC and again at Cannae in 216 BC. It is believed that Scipio Africanus promoted the use throughout the Roman army. It was eventually replaced by the Spatha around 300 AD."
 spatha_inv_desc: "The earlier gladius sword was gradually replaced by the spatha from the late 2nd to the 3rd century AD. From the early 3rd century, legionaries and cavalrymen began to wear their swords on the left side, perhaps because the scutum had been abandoned and the spatha had replaced the gladius."
 pilum_inv_desc: "Another iconic Roman weapon, the pilum could be used as a javelin or spear. The standard legion of the late republic/ early empire legionary would carry two pila and throw one before charging an enemy with their gladius. It could also be held against cavalry charges, in which Julius Caesar decisively defeated Pompey Magnus at the Battle of Pharsalus by ordering his troops to use it as a thrusting spear rather than throwing it. It is believed that Gaius Marius replaced one of the shaft pieces with wood to make it unusable after it was launched, rendering it useless against counter attack, though evidence suggests it was not adopted for long. I'll let the nerds decided; some of them get really mad about it."
 verutum_inv_desc: "A short javelin used by Velites and other light infantry. It was taken out of service along with the velites in the 2nd century BC but readopted in the late empire. I was surprised too; I thought they just used pila."
 pugio_inv_desc: "A leaf-shaped dagger that would not be on the invention list if I wasn't going for some sort of consistency. They stayed in the Roman arsenal to its fall so that's kinda cool."
 falcata_inv_desc: "The falcata is a type of sword typical of pre-Roman Iberia. The falcata was used to great effect for warfare in the ancient Iberian peninsula, and is firmly associated with the southern Iberian tribes, among other ancient peoples of Hispania. It was highly prized by the ancient general Hannibal, who equipped Carthaginian troops with it during the Second Punic War."
 soliferrum_inv_desc: "Latin for only iron, this Iberian ranged pole weapon uused as a heavy javelin was--you guessed it--made entirely of iron. Heavy with a narrow, barbed tip, this javelin was highly effective."

The hilt has a large plate guard and a wide finger guard connected to the pommel. The pommel is round and flat with a spike projecting from its centre. The spike may be used offensively or as a grip when delivering a two-handed stroke."

 sica_inv_desc: "The main Illyrian fighting sword was the sica, a short single-edged curved sword used by the Thraex gladiators in the Roman world. The sica was developed during the Bronze Age and was similar to the Greek machaira. It was originally depicted as a curved sword with a blade about 16–18 inches (41–46 centimetres) long. The distinctive shape was designed to get around the sides of an opponent's shield in order to stab or slash him in the back. Although the sica was used by many peoples around the Balkans, the Romans regarded the sica as a distinctive Illyrian weapon."

It was dropped onto enemy ships, which would then swing on to defensive forces and destroy them."
