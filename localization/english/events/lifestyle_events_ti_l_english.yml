 lifestyle_events.11.desc: "Did you ever hear the tale of#E Midas the Gilded#!? It's not a story the poor would tell you. It's a Phrygian myth.#E Midas#!... was a monarch so greedy and so obsessed with amassing wealth, he desired to have more gold than any other man. He had such a fixation on gold that when picking his reward for treating#E Silenus#! well, he asked for the power to transform all he touched into that glittering treasure. The worship of#E Dionysus#! is a pathway to many abilities... some consider to be unnatural. He was granted his wish, and at first, he reveled in this newfound ability, seeking to turn all of his possessions into solid gold. Which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, upon embracing his daughter, Marigold, she too turned to gold. Then, in horror, he prayed to#E Dionysus#! for a way to reverse the process. It's ironic. He could prevent himself from turning to gold, but not others. "
