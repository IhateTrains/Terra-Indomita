  lifestyle_event_chains.1.desc:0 "Bored by the duties of rulership, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has recently been considering getting a#E new hobby#!. The art of#E minting coins #!has caught [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention, and some advisors suggest that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis]#E direct involvement #!in the mints could yield#E significant benefits#! for the long-term stability and prosperity of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] explores this newfound interest, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] thoughts turn to summoning a#E master minter#! to teach [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] about the craft. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] must now decide whether to personally#E take charge#! of the mints or to maintain the#E status quo#!."

[master_minter.HerHis]#E unparalleled expertise#! in metallurgy and coin minting make [master_minter.GetHerHim] an ideal candidate for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to#E study under#!. Initially, [master_minter.GetName] was reluctant to stay away from his mint for an extended period. However, [master_minter.GetName] soon changed [master_minter.GetHerHis] tune when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] offered a#E handsome sum#! of precious metals and accommodations in return for [master_minter.GetHerHis] expertise.

A durable and practical choice. Casting the coins in copper would certainly be a#E pragmatic choice#!. They would be suitable for everyday use, but will oxidize into an unseemly hue. \n#Y Silver:#! A more prestigious option. Forging coins of pure silver would be less practical for everyday transactions, but they would certainly cast an image of#E prosperity and opulence#!. \n#Y Gold:#! The most#E luxurious choice#!.
