 omen_zengzi_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nZengzi, known for his teachings on benevolence, righteousness, and propriety, was a philosopher and devoted disciple of Confucius. His deep commitment to Confucian principles led him to emphasize the importance of cultivating these virtues in individuals and society as a whole.\n\nZengzi firmly believed that through the practice of benevolence, people could foster harmonious relationships, and by upholding righteousness, they could create a just and ethical society. Furthermore, he stressed the significance of propriety in daily life, advocating for proper conduct and respect for social norms. Zengzi's teachings recorded in the Analects of Confucius contributed significantly to the development of Confucianism as a prominent school of thought in China."

 omen_xunzi:0 "Xunzi"
 omen_xunzi_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nXun Kuang, better known by the honorific Xunzi, was a giant of Confucian philosophy but had lost popularity by the Han Dynasty. His teachings were fundamentally centered on human nature and ethical cultivation. His philosophy challenged the notion of inherent human goodness, asserting instead that individuals are shaped by education and moral discipline. At the core of his beliefs lay the conviction that people must actively cultivate virtue, emphasizing the importance of rituals and traditions as a means to foster ethical behavior.\n\nXunzi played a pivotal role in revitalizing Confucianism during a period when it faced challenges from other philosophical schools. His systematic approach to Confucian thought helped solidify its place as a prominent ideology in Chinese society. His writings, particularly the work to which he lent his name, the #E Xunzi#!, provided a comprehensive framework for understanding and practicing Confucian values, emphasizing the importance of a well-ordered society governed by strict moral principles."

 omen_yanhui:0 "Yan Hui"
 omen_yanhui_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nThe favorite disciple of Confucius himself, Yan Hui, is one of the most revered figures in Confucianism. His teachings and unwavering dedication to the principles of Confucian thought have left an indelible mark on the tradition. Eventually, during the Han Dynasty period, Yan Hui was venerated along the same lines as Confucius.\n\nYan Hui's life was tragically brief, as he passed away at a mere 29 years of age. It is believed that he might have been one of the earliest recorded cases of progeria, a condition characterized by rapid aging. Confucius was said to have shown 'excessive' grief upon the loss of his favorite disciple. He went so far as to declare that no other student could ever take the place left vacant by Yan's demise, recognizing Yan as the most dedicated and wisest among all his disciples."

 deity_mencius:0 "$omen_mencius$"
 omen_mencius:0 "Mengzi"
 omen_mencius_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nMengzi, known to the Roman world as Mencius, was one of the most influential Ru after Confucius himself. His teachings center on a profound belief in the innate goodness of human nature, a concept that sets him apart within the Confucian tradition. Mencius passionately advocated for the welfare of the common citizens within a state, emphasizing their significance as the heart of a prosperous society.\n\nOne of Mencius' groundbreaking ideas was the assertion that it is justifiable for subjects to rise against their rulers if those rulers neglect the needs and well-being of the people. This stance represents a significant departure from conventional Confucian thought, which often leans toward supporting the ruling class. Mencius did not undermine the importance of rulers and kings but, in a unique way, recognized the vital role of peasants and freemen in the stability and prosperity of a state."

 deity_confucius:0 "$omen_confucius$"
 omen_confucius:0 "Kongzi"
 omen_confucius_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nThe most famous of all Ru philosophers and the name from which we derive 'Confucianism,' Kongzi (birth name Kong Qiu, better known in the Roman world as Confucius) is one of the greatest men to come from the history of Chinese civilization. His school of Ruism would go on to remain relevant for centuries to come. Despite all this, Kong never considered himself anything but a transmitter of earlier beliefs. However, it's clear his influence on the school of Ruism would be equal to none, and his disciples would follow in his footsteps in firmly establishing Confucian Ruism in Chinese society.\n\nKongzi's core teachings revolved around the cultivation of moral virtue, ethical governance, and the pursuit of becoming a noble soul like the proverbial 'junzi'. His emphasis on filial piety, respect for tradition, and the importance of ritual and propriety served as foundational principles of Confucian thought. Through his devoted disciples, Kongzi's influence extended far beyond his lifetime, cementing Confucian Ruism as a dominant philosophical and ethical tradition in Chinese society."

 omen_zisi:0 "Zisi"
 omen_zisi_desc:0 "#Y School of Scholars#! \nZisi, the grandson of Confucius, played a pivotal role in transmitting the profound teachings of Confucius and the Ruist school to the influential philosopher Mencius. His philosophical contributions delved into the realms of meditation and the humbling recognition of humanity's limited knowledge in the vast expanse of the universe. In contrast to his grandfather's emphasis on distinguishing between true and supposed knowledge, Zisi illuminated the value of introspection and the pursuit of wisdom through inner reflection.\n\nZisi's teachings underscored the significance of inner contemplation as a means to cultivate moral virtue and spiritual growth. He advocated for a deeper understanding of the self, recognizing that true wisdom arises from acknowledging the limits of human knowledge in the grand cosmic scheme. This perspective offered a unique dimension to the Confucian tradition, enriching it with a profound sense of humility and reverence for the mysteries of existence. As a bridge between Confucius and Mencius, Zisi's legacy endures as a testament to the evolution of Confucian thought, blending the wisdom of the past with the innovative insights that continue to shape ethical philosophy in China and beyond."

King Wu united his fellow vassals and won a stunning victory against the Shang forces in the Battle of Muye.

 omen_likui_desc:0 "#Y School of Legalism#! \nLi Kui, known as the mastermind of ancient China, was a polymath of extraordinary prowess, acting at various points as an engineer, philosopher, and astute governor. In his capacity as an engineer, his innovations were akin to miracles, transforming arid landscapes into verdant oases through meticulously designed irrigation systems. His architectural prowess gave rise to breathtaking edifices that seemed to touch the heavens themselves.\n\nYet, it was as a philosopher that Li Kui's influence truly reverberated through the ages. His teachings were a profound wellspring of wisdom, delving into the very essence of human existence. He expounded upon the principles of virtue, urging individuals to cultivate not only their minds but also their hearts. His ethical philosophy emphasized the importance of harmony, not only in society but within oneself, advocating for the unity of the inner and outer worlds.\n\nLi Kui's political acumen was informed by his philosophical insights, believing that a just and stable society could only be achieved through the harmonious coexistence of its parts. His counsel was sought by rulers and emperors, and his strategies, rooted in principles of benevolence and righteousness, often led to the stability and prosperity of his realm."

His major teachings not only encompassed the principles of governance but also emphasized the importance of a strong central authority, an equitable distribution of resources, and the need for benevolent rule to ensure the well-being of the people.\n\nGuan Zhong meticulously compiled his reflections on governance, diplomacy, and administrative practices into 'Guanzi,' his magnum opus. His wisdom and pragmatic approach to politics, forged in the crucible of martial conflict, laid the foundation for the philosophy of Legalism."

 omen_shenbuhai:0 "Shen Buhai"
 omen_shenbuhai_desc:0 "#Y School of Legalism#! \nShen Buhai, a luminary of ancient Chinese philosophy and governance, was renowned for his significant contributions to the realm of political thought. His major teachings revolved around the concept of efficient governance through a well-structured bureaucracy. Shen Buhai believed that a ruler should exercise power through a well-organized system of government, emphasizing the importance of administrative competence and order. \n\nIn his seminal work, “Shenzi,” he explored the principles of statecraft and the role of political authority. Shen Buhai's philosophy laid the groundwork for the Legalist school of thought, which later had a profound influence on the governance of China. His emphasis on clear laws, impartial enforcement, and the centralization of authority greatly contributed to the development of the Chinese bureaucratic system."

 omen_zichan_desc:0 "#Y School of Legalism#! \nThe philosopher and political Zichan was best known for his teachings on governance and social order. Central to his philosophy were the principles of benevolence, frugality, and ethical leadership, which he considered fundamental pillars for the successful administration of a state.\n\nHaving served as the chief minister of the State of Zheng for an extended period, Zichan ardently believed that a ruler's foremost duty was to prioritize the well-being of the people. This core tenet of his philosophy emphasized the need for policies that would alleviate poverty, stimulate economic growth, and ensure fairness in resource distribution. One of Zichan's most notable contributions to governance was the implementation of comprehensive land reforms. These reforms aimed to rectify disparities in land ownership and to ease the burdens on the common citizens."

 deity_shangyang:0 "$omen_shangyang$"
 omen_shangyang:0 "Shang Yang"
 omen_shangyang_desc:0 "#Y School of Legalism#! \nShang Yang, also known as Wei Yang, emerged as a prominent figure in Chinese history, primarily remembered for his influential teachings and contributions to the state of Qin. Born as the son of a concubine in the court of Wei, Shang Yang chose to leave his position in Wei to lend his expertise and support to the state of Qin. His pivotal role in aiding Qin during its attack on Wei earned him considerable recognition, including a reward of fifteen cities as a token of appreciation for his contributions to the war effort.\n\nShang Yang's enduring legacy lies in his association with the legalist school of thought, where he is regarded as one of its most prominent proponents, alongside the likes of Han Fei, who was inspired by the work of Shang Yang. Shang Yang's influence extended beyond theory, as he implemented numerous reforms that played a crucial role in the rise of the Qin state. These reforms encompassed areas such as land distribution and military organization, all of which contributed significantly to Qin's eventual success."

 # Daoism / School of the Way

 omen_sun_wukong:0 "Sun Wukong"
 omen_sun_wukong_desc:0 "#Y Chinese God#! \nSun Wukong, known as Son Goku in Japanese, is among the most renowned figures in Chinese culture. He was worshipped across Eastern Asia as the celebrated Monkey King, a deity associated with agility, strength, and wit. Legend has it that he could effortlessly bear the weight of two heavenly mountains while moving at meteoric speeds. With a single somersault, he could traverse over 30,000 miles, and his memory was unparalleled, retaining the names of every monkey ever born.\n\nSun Wukong's fame extended far and wide due to his incredible journey to the west. In this epic odyssey, he embarked on a quest to obtain sacred scriptures, joined by his loyal companions, including the mischievous Pigsy and the monk Tripitaka. This journey, chronicled in the literary classic #E Journey to the West#!, is a testament to Sun Wukong's indomitable spirit and his transformation from a rebellious deity to a devoted guardian.\n\nThe origins of Sun Wukong have sparked numerous theories, with some of the earliest ones tracing back to the Chu Kingdom in 8th-century CE China. This era was rich in legends and myths featuring monkeys and gibbons, and these tales melded with local Daoist beliefs to shape an early rendition of the iconic Monkey King. It's also conceivable that Sun Wukong's legend predates this period, possibly emerging from the lore of other monkey deities found in the Fuzhou province, situated west of Taiwan. Throughout history, Sun Wukong has been depicted as both a Daoist and Buddhist figure, embodying the spiritual traditions of the region."

 omen_zhuangzi:0 "Zhuangzi"
 omen_zhuangzi_desc:0 "#Y School of the Way#! \nThe teachings of Zhuangzi are about the art of living in harmony with the Dao, or Way. Central to his philosophy was the idea that individuals should seek to attain a state of natural spontaneity, transcending rigid social conventions and desires.\n\nZhuangzi often employed allegorical tales and anecdotes to illustrate his philosophical concepts, emphasizing the relativity of human perspectives and the illusory nature of distinctions between right and wrong. His contributions to Daoism are of paramount importance. Zhuangzi's writings, collected as the #E Zhuangzi#!, are considered foundational texts within Daoist thought. They explore themes of freedom, the relativity of truth, and the importance of embracing change as essential elements of the Daoist path. Zhuangzi's emphasis on the relativity of human perspectives and the illusory nature of distinctions between right and wrong deeply influenced the development of Daoist philosophy and its practical applications in areas such as meditation, martial arts, and holistic living."

 omen_lieyukou_desc:0 "#Y School of the Way#! \nLie Yukou, renowned as the author of the Daoist masterpiece 'Liezi,' made significant contributions to the realm of Daoist philosophy. Hailing from the state of Zheng, his life remains shrouded in mystery, with sparse historical records due in part to book burnings orchestrated by the Daoists themselves.\n\nSome scholars have entertained the intriguing possibility that Lie Yukou might have been a creation of the legendary Zhuangzi, an exemplar designed to embody the principles of Daoism. Despite the uncertainties surrounding his existence, the 'Liezi' remains a treasured Daoist text, delving into the profound concepts of the Dao, natural spontaneity, and the relativity of human perspectives. It continues to inspire seekers of the Way, contributing to the rich tapestry of Daoist philosophy."

 omen_huangdi:0 "Huangdi"
 omen_huangdi_desc:0 "#Y Chinese God#! \nHuangdi, or the Yellow Emperor, is a shen representing the center of the universe. He is known as the deity of 'Four Faces,' which speaks to his vision of a unity controlled in four directions. Chinese Daoists of this time often credited Huangdi as the originator of Daoist principles over Laozi. He is an immortal being of Daoism and existed far before Daoism was a school of thought. Huangdi existed as a Shenic god before Chinese Daoists would see him as a Daoist shen instead."

 omen_laozi:0 "Laozi"
 omen_laozi_desc:0 "#Y School of the Way#! \nLaozi (often called Lao Tzu in the modern West), is usually considered to be the founder of the School of the Way but remains a semi-mythical figure. His major teachings are encapsulated in the foundational text of Daoism, the 'Daodejing,' where he expounds upon the Dao, Qi, and other fundamental principles.\n\nMost accounts state that Laozi was a contemporary of the philosophers of the Warring States period, like Confucius. Laozi's name is an honorific title meaning 'The Old Master'. His personal name is traditionally recorded as Li Er, but variants include Lao Zhen or Li Zhen, and the courtesy names Dan and Boyang are also recorded. Laozi's legacy endures through the timeless wisdom found in the Daodejing, helping adherents understand the tenets of Daoism and the path to harmonious living until the modern day."

His major teachings emphasized the importance of adhering to principles and realities, meticulously scrutinizing laws, and establishing authoritative governance.\n\nDespite his talents and contributions, Deng Xi's personal code clashed with the policies of the Zheng state's higher officials, ultimately leading to his execution. One of Deng Xi's notable ideas revolved around the concept that a wise king is one who 'follows names and observes actualities, examines laws and establishes authority.' Deng Xi is chiefly remembered as a legal reformer who challenged traditional Confucian ideas, offering alternative perspectives that contributed to the evolution of governance and legal philosophy in ancient China."

 # Mohism / School of Mo
 deity_mozi:0 "$omen_mozi$"
 omen_mozi:0 "Mozi"
 omen_mozi_desc:0 "#Y School of Mo#! \nThe founder of Mohism, Mo Di (more commonly known by the honorific Mozi, sometimes rendered in the modern West as Mo Tzu or Micius), was one of the greats of Chinese philosophy. One of the key concepts in Mo's utilitarian ethical system is Jian Ai, or Universal Love, which became one of his lasting influences in Chinese culture. Mozi emphasised the collective good over the individual, teaching for example that people can only effectively love their own parents by loving the elderly in general as only a society that loves the elderly will truly ensure the wellbeing of any individual person's parents. This stands in contrast to Ruist conceptions of filial love (Xiao) as distinct from Ai and unique to one's relationship with one's own parents.\n\nImportantly, Mozi taught absolute opposition to offensive wars. This position is sometimes misunderstood in that the Mohists were not pacifists but in fact operated as an association of strictly defensive military engineers, knights and advisors. Much of the reason Mohism persisted was due to this expertise in defensive warfare which made the Mohists invaluable to many kings. Famously, Mozi would convince the Chu Kingdom not to attack the Song Kingdom despite having superior numbers. He did this by convincing the Chu that the Song, which was filled with Mohists, had the ability beyond anyone else to dismantle the advanced siege weaponry of the Chu. In round after round of mock battles, Mozi would always win against the general Gongshu. Ultimately, the Chu Kingdom would not war on Song, seeing little to gain but much to lose."

 omen_shangdi_desc:0 "#Y Chinese God#! \nShangdi (the Lord Above) was the supreme deity in the pantheon of the Shang Dynasty and was conflated with Tian (Heaven itself) by the early Zhou. For the Mohists, Tian Zhi (the Intention of Heaven) refers to the key ethical principle that the governance of human societies must accord with the will of Tian personified as Shangdi. Shangdi's importance to Mohism lies not in his worship itself but in the establishment of a precedent for good governance."

Yu predates Mozi and his school by at least a thousand years, yet the Mohist canon treats him as an exemplar of good rulership guided by the principles of Jian Ai (Universal Love) and Tian Zhi (Heaven's Intention). In fact, many Mohists believed it was their duty to follow in Yu the Great's altruism. It is said that Mozi turned his back on the Zhou Dynasty and instead embraced the governance of Yu the Great, claiming his doctrine to be the same as that practiced by the ancient sages, the three sovereigns and five emperors."

 omen_minggui_desc:0 "#Y School of Mo#! \nGuishen zhi Ming (the ming-ness of ghosts and gods, where the word ming literally means radiance but carries an additional meaning of moral discernment) is an important concept in Mohist ethics with varying interpretations. Mozi himself preached that ming (radiant or morally discerning) ghosts would ensure that evildoers were punished and the virtuous were rewarded. Interestingly, the examples he cites are of mortals dispensing justice with the apparent aid of ming ghosts who reveal the sins of the evildoer. Later Mohist writers downplay the literal interpretation and view the ghosts as a metaphor for the self-destructive nature of unprovoked violence."

 omen_universal_love_desc:0 "#Y School of Mo#!\nThe doctrine of Jian Ai is the most famous of all of the doctrines of the School of Mo. Directly translated, it means Impartial Care, or, Universal Love. Mohists believe that one should love others as oneself, regardless of familial relation. This last point is often a sticking point for the rival school of Ruism, who believe that a son should love their father more than he would a stranger.\n\nFor Mohists, a good society is one in which love is universal - thus one in which the people are equally protected, equally fed and housed, and in which there is no war because people love each other's cities as much as their own. Favouritism, nepotism and corruption in politics are anathema to the Mohists, and so is offensive war."

An anecdote recounted by Han Fei just over a century later tells of how Tian Jiu explained to the king of Chu (who had asked why 'Mozi's words were many but not eloquent') that Mohists placed emphasis on content rather than rhetorical form in debate, being concerned only with real-world results and not with deceiving anyone by the use of pretty words."

He was a close confidant of Lord Yangcheng, who entrusted Meng Sheng to exercise his authority in his absence and gave him half of a ritual jade huang to symbolise their companionship. After the death of King Dao of Chu, Lord Yangcheng was implicated along with more than 70 others in a conspiracy to assassinate general Wu Qi, who ended up being killed by archers while mourning next to the late king's body which was also pierced by the arrows. King Dao's successor, King Su, ordered that everyone involved in the assassination of Wu Qi and the desecration of King Dao's body be killed along with their families. Following this, for his loyalty to Lord Yangcheng, Meng Sheng died along with 180 of his followers. It is unclear whether they died in battle against King Su or by mass suicide. In any case, Meng Sheng's friendship and loyalty to Lord Yangcheng stands as an exemplar of sorts."

According to Master Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals, Fu Tun's son murdered someone in the state of Qin but King Huiwen of Qin offered a pardon out of respect for the Mohist leader.

The general promised to let Hufeizi go free, but only if he could give a satisfactory explanation of Mohist non-violence. Hufeizi explained that there are five types of courage or heroism - that of a hunter, of a fisherman, of a master potter, of an executioner and of a gentleman - and recounted the story of how general Cao Mo convinced the Duke of Qi to cease bullying the weaker state of Lu by threatening to cut his own throat and splash the king with blood, exemplifying the courage of a gentleman.

Mozi taught that good practice requires reliance on models and exemplars rather than innate virtue. The models and exemplars he cites for political practice are the ancient Sage-Kings, while in reference to engineering he describes the importance of precise measurements. Fa, the first part of the compound term Fayi, became the central concept of the Legalist school (Fajia) but is considered to have been first elaborated as a key philosophical paradigm by Mozi. Later innovations in Legalism reveal a confluence of early Mohist and Daoist influences within a changing political context which gave centrality to the concept of Fa."

Through expert diplomacy, Yue Yi orchestrated alliances with various states, including Wei, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Qin, uniting their forces to cripple the ascendant Qi. His leadership on the battlefield proved instrumental as he masterminded the downfall of Qi, leading to the exile of its ruthless king and nearly bringing the entire Qi territory under control.\n\nYue Yi was personally granted control over the region of Chang by his benefactor, King Zhao, but things rapidly changed following the sudden demise of King Zhao, leaving the state in chaos and Yue Yi without a patron. The Qi exploited this moment of weakness and recovered part of their lost territory, causing Yue Yi to flee to Zhao, fearing that the new King of Yan, Hui would lead the forces of Yan to total ruin. This soon came to pass, the Qi decimating the armies of the overconfident Yan. King Hui eventually managed to win Yue Yi over and was entrusted with sweeping powers.

His major teaching revolved around the concept of “perspectivism.” Hui Shi proposed that all statements were valid from their own perspective, challenging the notion of absolute truth. This perspective-centric philosophy encouraged a deep examination of language and how it shapes our understanding of reality. His emphasis on linguistic relativity prompted profound discussions among scholars and laid the groundwork for later philosophical inquiries.\n\nOne of the most memorable episodes in Hui Shi's life was his spirited debate with the renowned Daoist philosopher #E Zhuangzi#! about the nature of reality and perception. Zhuangzi questioned the validity of Hui Shi's perspective, using the example of a fish. He argued that if a fish’s perspective is limited to its watery environment, it would have no concept of what lies beyond the water. Hui Shi's response to this debate, often referred to as the “Butterfly Dream,” highlighted his philosophical position that perspectives shape our understanding of reality and thus that all perspectives have validity. Hui Shi's ideas had a significant impact on the development of Chinese thought."

 omen_xuxing_desc:0 "#Y School of Agriculturalism#! \nXu Xing, a prominent figure within the School of Agriculturalism, championed the philosophy of agriculturalism as a means to achieve social equality and prosperity.\n\nHis core teaching was that every member of society, including the nobility, should actively engage in the production of food and other agricultural goods and participate in the preparation of their meals. This egalitarian vision aimed to establish a society where all individuals shared equal status and responsibilities. Xu Xing's ideals, however, faced significant challenges in a world where social mobility through military or political achievements was prevalent. The teachings of his School advocated for a return to a simpler way of life, akin to the times of the Divine Farmer, Shennong, and called for fixed market prices to prevent exploitation."
