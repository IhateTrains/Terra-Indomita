Through expert diplomacy, Yue Yi orchestrated alliances with various states, including Wei, Chu, Han, Zhao, and Qin, uniting their forces to cripple the ascendant Qi. His leadership on the battlefield proved instrumental as he masterminded the downfall of Qi, leading to the exile of its ruthless king and nearly bringing the entire Qi territory under control.\n\nYue Yi was personally granted control over the region of Chang by his benefactor, King Zhao, but things rapidly changed following the sudden demise of King Zhao, leaving the state in chaos and Yue Yi without a patron. The Qi exploited this moment of weakness and recovered part of their lost territory, causing Yue Yi to flee to Zhao, fearing that the new King of Yan, Hui would lead the forces of Yan to total ruin. This soon came to pass, the Qi decimating the armies of the overconfident Yan. King Hui eventually managed to win Yue Yi over and was entrusted with sweeping powers. Thanks to Yue Yi's battlefield brilliance, the Yan managed to consolidate their holdings and avoided a total loss."
