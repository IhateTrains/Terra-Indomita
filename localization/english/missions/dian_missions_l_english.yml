 dian_missions: "An Accidental Kingdom"
 dian_missions_DESCRIPTION: "The great state of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] lay around a large lake bearing the same name, in the mountains and valleys at the southeastern edge of #E Tibet#!. At the end of the 4th century BC, the people in #E Dian#! were renowned metalsmiths, crafting bronze, gold and silver artwork with influences from places such as [GetCountry('CHU').GetName] and [GetCountry('LCV').GetName]. However, an air of tension is rising in the idyllic kingdom at the edge of civilization, as the #E Warring States#! conflict rages on, and political developments in the #E Middle Kingdom#! are on the verge of boiling over into regions beyond their current grasp..." 
 dian_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] conquers the tribal states surrounding it, embraces kingship and becomes a bridge between #E India#! and #E China#!. "

#Missions

 dian_missions_task_1: "Conquer Kunming"
 dian_missions_task_1_DESC: "The ever-present barbarian [GetCountry('TB2').GetName] tribes lay to our north, streaming down from #E Tibet#! in droves. For too long have their barbaric raids and cavalry tactics plagued our fields and murdered our innocent farming communities. The time has come to once and for all civilize the #E Kunming#! tribesmen, and absorb their strategic lands into our budding kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil2!"

 dian_missions_task_2: "Eastern Tribes"
 dian_missions_task_2_DESC: "The lesser lords of the #E Xinggu#! area to our east have long eluded the reach of our leader [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s grasp. The various statelets are nothing but backwards barbarians not realizing the full potential of their lands. If we ever hope to protect ourselves from the domination of the northern #E Huaxia#! peoples, we must secure our eastern flank and incorporate the eastern peoples into our way of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

 dian_missions_task_3: "Agriculture and Cattle"
 dian_missions_task_3_DESC: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], our great state of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has a burgeoning population, but our investment in the production of foodstuffs - whether through farming or herding - has not kept pace with the number of people in the capital. We should spend the money to improve our food security, lest the people find other ways to feed their hunger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 dian_missions_task_4: "Zhuang Qiao"
 dian_missions_task_4_DESC: "The turmoil within the #E Warring States#! to our north is now threatening to spill over into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], as political instability and war brought upon the nation of [GetCountry('CHU').GetName] has caused rogue bands of #E Chu#! peoples to begin showing up at our borders. The fate of our state may be determined by the events unfolding in the #E Middle Kingdom#!...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil14!"

 dian_missions_task_5_DESC: "The peoples of the land of [GetCountry('SMI').GetName] share many of our cultural practices, and hold strategic lands just to our north, on the path to #E Sichuan#!. If we should happen to incorporate them, either by diplomacy or by force, then we will be in a prime position to dominate the whole of the #E Nanzhong#! region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

 dian_missions_task_6: "To The Coast"
 dian_missions_task_6_DESC: "The prosperous trade of the #Y Red River#! and Great Ocean lay just to our southeast, lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. While numerous barbarian peoples lay between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and the coast, subduing these rowdy clans should be a simple task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

 dian_missions_task_7: "The Age Of Bronze"
 dian_missions_task_7_DESC: "Bronzeware production has been a hallmark of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for many generations, with ceremonial objects being used for rituals at court and exported abroad. Our metalsmiths require an expansion of the tin and copper mines, as well as new workshops, to meet the demands for our fine wares, and to produce objects worthy of your palace, lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 dian_missions_task_8: "Advanced Technology"
 dian_missions_task_8_DESC: "Our increasing relation with the [GetCountry('CHU').GetName] peoples is beginning to show us just how much we have yet to learn, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. The #E Chu#! have teased but a few of their technological secrets to us, but if we are to control our own destiny, we must elevate #E Chu#! nobles to positions of power to persuade them to share their innovations with the Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

 dian_missions_task_9: "Twice The Pride, Double The Fall" 
 dian_missions_task_9_DESC: "Our primary rival in the lands south of the #Y Yangtze River#!, the [GetCountry('YLG').GetName], has been a constant pain in the rear end of King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], resisting cooperation and friendship at every turn. It is even said that their ruler, [GetCountry('YLG').GetRuler.GetName], believes himself equal or greater than the #E Huaxia#! kings and the #Y Son of Heaven#!. We should extinguish the arrogant upstarts once and for all, and sing tales of their demise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@celt_mil1!"

 dian_missions_task_10: "We Need More Shells"
 dian_missions_task_10_DESC: "Among the most lucrative trading networks along the coasts of the Great Ocean is that of the shells, particularly tortoiseshell and cowrie shells. Should [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] claim the territories necessary to dominate this trade, the coffers of the imperial treasury will surely begin to overflow!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil8!"

 dian_missions_task_11: "Royal Tombs"
 dian_missions_task_11_DESC: "While we have always venerated our ancestors, the style in which the #E Chu#! and other peoples of the #E Middle Kingdom#! adorn the tombs of their dead has left an impression on King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and the noblemen of our kingdom. The ministers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have been instructed with investigating the costs of constructing such a royal tomb for our great late monarch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

 dian_missions_task_12: "To The Himalayas"
 dian_missions_task_12_DESC: "While we have long dispensed with the threat of the #E Kunming#!, other #E Tibetan#! tribes at the eastern edge of the plateau, such as the [GetCountry('QIO').GetName] and [GetCountry('ZUO').GetName], continue to pillage our northern holdings, and present a viable path of invasion to our homeland around #Y Lake Dian#! by the #E Huaxia#! peoples. We must secure these lands, lest we always be in fear of barbarian raids and foreign invaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

 dian_missions_task_13: "Chinese Embassy"
 dian_missions_task_13_DESC: "As we have become more like the #E Chu#! since the events surrounding the arrival of #E Zhuang Qiao#!, the Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now has the potential to help shape and direct the political developments in the #E Middle Kingdom#! to its benefit. Should we decide to step into the ring against the #E Warring States#!, we must decide which states we should align ourselves with, as we cannot make enemies of everyone...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil3!"

 dian_missions_task_14: "Returning The Favor"
 dian_missions_task_14_DESC: "While we have had time to reconcile with the invasion of #E Chu#! generals, we will not forget the transgressions against our venerable kingdom. The military strategists in the court of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] believe now is the time to return the favor to the [GetCountry('CHU').GetName]; we should strike forth into the #E Jing#! region south of the #Y Yangtze River#! and claim the vast lands for ourselves!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

 dian_missions_task_15: "New Capital"
 dian_missions_task_15_DESC: "The Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become a bastion of civilization in #E Nanzhong#!, o lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. But our capital at [GetProvince('(int32)8914').GetName] is becoming overcrowded with a lack of housing, and does not yet possess the architectural brilliance of the states of the #E Middle Kingdom#!. We should construct new buildings and palatial estates to display our newfound wealth and glory to both subjects and foreign dignitaries alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil10!"

 dian_missions_task_16: "Steppe Art"
 dian_missions_task_16_DESC: "While our contact with the #E Chu#! and the #E Huaxia#! peoples as whole has had by far the greatest impact on our cultural development, we must not ignore the influence on the #E Rong#! horsemen on our society. Indeed, their mastery of equine arts and cavalry tactics have long fascinated the court at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wishes to hire artists to mimic the great art styles of the #E Rong#! by commissioning the creation of new vessels for our reliquaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil5!"

 dian_missions_task_17: "Highway to India"
 dian_missions_task_17_DESC: "The road through the rough terrain and multitude of tribes to the lands of #E India#! will not be easy to secure, lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. #E Yongchang#!, while close in distance, is a difficult land to traverse and is inhabited by the [GetCountry('AIL').GetName]. Beyond them, the area of #E Pubu#! has seen throngs of #E Pyu#! peoples invade from #E Tibet#!, displacing and absorbing #E Pu#! peoples along the way. If we could somehow manage to tame these treacherous lands, however, the fabulous land trade routes from #E India#! to #E China#! will be ours to monopolize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"

 dian_missions_task_18: "Royal Seal Of Dian"
 dian_missions_task_18_DESC: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wishes to fashion a new royal seal in the style of the great states of the #E Middle Kingdom#!. The royal council of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been tasked with discovering a way to fashion such an artifact, either through diplomatic acquisition from #E Chinese#! friends or finding a way to replicate their quality ourselves...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil15!"

 me_dian_1_desc: "In every corner of their valleys, and atop every mountain of their lands, the resistance of the [GetCountry('TB2').GetName] tribes has been extinguished.

The remaining populace will work the lands in servitude of our lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], as loyal subjects of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_dian_1.a: "The Kunming will bow to us."

 me_dian_2_title: "$dian_missions_task_2$"
 me_dian_2_desc: "The eastern tribesmen of #E Xinggu#! were of no match for our superiority in manpower and tactics. The barbarians charged headlong into the fray, screaming violently to instill terror into the hearts of the men of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Just as the men were beginning to lose some nerve, our King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] rode up from the rear of the enemy, catching them by surprise as their formations melted between anvil and hammer. The remaining clans of the area quickly sued for peace."

 me_dian_3_title: "$dian_missions_task_3$"
 me_dian_3_desc: "The recommended financing of the construction of new enclosures and farms has paid off, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].

 me_dian_3.a: "Our people will be well fed."

 me_dian_4_title: "$dian_missions_task_4$"
 me_dian_4_desc: "One by one, various clans of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] were swayed by #E Zhuang Qiao#! on his march to #Y Lake Dian#!, either by forceful coersion or opportunistic greed, to betray our tribal king, in exchange for promises of money and power in his new order. The gates of [GetProvince('(int32)8914').GetName] were opened by members of the traitor clans, and the victorious general fought his way through the royal body guard to take our king prisoner, along with any remaining loyal clan leaders."
 me_dian_4.a: "A Chu general now rules Dian!"

Should he succeed, #E Dian#! may see a new king rise..."

 me_dian_401_title: "$dian_missions_task_4$"
 me_dian_401_desc: "The guards near the northeast border of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] fought valiantly against general #E Zhuang Qiao#!, however they were no match for organized #E Chinese#! force trained in proper battlefield tactics. Seeing the hopelessness of the situation, clansmen in the countryside vulnerable to attack began to defect to this invader, and word reached our leader [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] in his court of [GetProvince('(int32)8914').GetName] the the vast host of his enemy was drawing close to the capital..."

 me_dian_5_desc: "The [GetCountry('SMI').GetName] clansmen to our north have finally come under the sway of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], my lord! Your majesty, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], graciously accepted the surrender of the tribal elites which ruled the principal settlements of their lands, while killing or taking prisoner the few who opposed us. The #E Dian#! people are now united under one banner."
 me_dian_5.a: "The Shoumi kinfolk are now in our domain."

 me_dian_6_title: "$dian_missions_task_6$"
 me_dian_6_desc: "As King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] sailed along the #Y Red River#!, he could finally see the coast of the Great Sea in the distance. A host of trade ships were moving along the coast in the distance, with some also seemingly anchored at port. While the journey through the jungles and barbarian lands was no easy task, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] felt validated in his quest to seek dominion over the Great Ocean as the potential for profit filled his eyes at the sight of these ships."
 me_dian_6.a: "We will become rich from coastal trade!"

 me_dian_7_desc: "After the construction of new workshops and mining operations in the lands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], our artisans and metalsmiths have been hard at work fashioning new bronzewares to be used as ritual pieces. One piece of art depicted a finely constructed home, replete with all of the typical household items of a [GetProvince('(int32)8914').GetName] home in miniature form. A second work depicted a humble servant, shielding our King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] from the harsh summer sun with a parasol. Both works were immediately hailed by the king and placed in our holy reliquary."
 me_dian_7.a: "Our metalwork is second to none."

 me_dian_8.a: "We have learned much from the Chu."

 me_dian_9_title: "$dian_missions_task_9$"
 me_dian_9_desc: "The forever arrogant Kingdom of [GetCountry('YLG').GetName], even in its final hour, gawked at the notion of their own inferiority. Their ruler still belittled our envoys while we asked for his peaceful surrender after they lost their armies in the field. The delusional leader insisted to our envoys that #E Yelang#! was still amongst the greatest powers in the known world. Our emissaries, unsure of whether to laugh, simply relayed the reaction to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who then ordered the forceful arrest of the #E Yelang#! king."

 me_dian_10_desc: "The Kindom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is finally in possession of sources of the great shell trade, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]!

Additionally, our artisans have commemorated our recent conquests over the shell producing provinces by creating a unique bronze shell storage vessel, in the name of you, o King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."
 me_dian_10.a: "The booming shell trade will make us wealthy."

 me_dian_11_title: "$dian_missions_task_11$"
 me_dian_11_desc: "As King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] stepped into the brightly adorned halls within the new royal tombs, he was awestruck by the brilliant architecture of statues, stone columns and archways. The entrance arch was studded with gemstones, and each tomb held offerings from across our realm consisting of incense, jade, gold, porcelain vessels and more. This, the king thought, was a necropolis worthy of the kings of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], including himself."
 me_dian_11.a: "The Royal Tombs are complete!"
 
 me_dian_1100_title: "$dian_missions_task_11$"
 me_dian_1100_desc: "The budget for the royal tombs has come to be staggering. However, we must not disgrace the name of our late king, or the prestige of the Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].

 me_dian_1100.a: "We will spare no expense."

 me_dian_12_desc: "The rugged lands of the [GetCountry('QIO').GetName] and [GetCountry('ZUO').GetName] peoples are now under our military occupation, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]! While the harsh conditions of the steep mountains of #E Tibetan#! did impart some attrition on our forces, we were able to overcome the barbarians and the terrain to tame this barren place at the edge of the world."

 me_dian_13_desc: "The financial ministers have informed King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that a variety of goods and gold have been gathered to present an ostentatious envoy to one of the courts of the #E Middle Kingdom#!. Some ministers believe we should send an emissary directly to the #E Son of Heaven#! himself in [GetCountry('ZHO').GetName]; yet others desire military secrets from the [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName], and finally the economists wish to establish relations with the wealthy [GetCountry('QII').GetName]."

 me_dian_14_desc: "The #E Miao#! lands which were once under the subjugation of the [GetCountry('CHU').GetName] state have now been liberated by you, o generous King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Your new subjects have conveyed at length the atrocities committed by the #E Chu#! government against their kind, so it is only fitting that we sacked the #E Chu#! towns and exacted revenge on officials accused of corruption and war crimes; against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and all others bullied by the #E Chu#!."
