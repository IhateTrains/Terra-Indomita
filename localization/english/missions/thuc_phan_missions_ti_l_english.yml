But thanks to the efforts of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], these fears have been calmed for the time being."

 me_thuc_phan_4_desc: "Although many assumed that the death of [SCOPE.sCharacter('thuc_phan_char').GetName]'s father #E Thuc Che#! would render him isolated politically and weak, everyone has underestimated the young man, who has deftly maneuvered his way through the court at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] with a skill that belies his age.\n\nBut his greatest triumph - a fatal blow to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - was privately securing the loyalty of the Lords that once swore oaths to his father, and once that fateful bridge had been crossed, the true authority of the tribe passed to [SCOPE.sCharacter('thuc_phan_char').GetFirstName] in that moment.\n\nWhen the bold youth declared that he would now be [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], there was no one left to stand with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who quickly realized the game was up."

 me_thuc_phan_901_desc: "Something miraculous happened today in [GetProvince('(int32)9188').GetName]; as the laborers continued to work on the foundations of the proposed citadel, the waters of the #E River Hong#! began to froth and churn. Moments later, a giant golden turtle, its carapace gleaming in the sun, swam up to the shore, where it then slowly crawled onto the soft banks before the murmuring crowds that were gathering. A golden claw was in its mouth, and the turtle dropped it onto the ground before turning towards the river once more.\n\nBy the time that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] went down to investigate, the turtle had disappeared, but the locals swear that it was the avatar of the god #E Kim Quy#!, who has blessed the construction of the citadel with a priceless gift."

 me_thuc_phan_10_desc: "The northern jungles and badlands that separate our borders from the staggering power of the #E Chinese#! kingdoms is a land filled with threatening #E Yue#! tribes. Notorious warmongers, these Yue dogs are easily persuaded by their avarice to launch invasions of their neighbors - a fact of life that has gone on for as long as anyone can remember, but no more.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has subjugated these barbarians under our yoke, extending our hinterlands far beyond what they have ever been. Thanks to the martial efforts of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], we shall no longer worry about Yue skirmishers raiding our settlements in the dead of night."

 me_thuc_phan_11_desc: "Now that we have secured the southern coastlines for ourselves, one of the first decrees given by the mighty [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] commanded that a navy be built in one of the ports that we have taken. This lawless land was once the plaything of pirates, especially the thieves living in the [GetProvince('(int32)9208').GetName] province, but with a strong fleet of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] ships patrolling the shores, we hope that we can limit the damaging raids of the buccaneers, if not put an end to them entirely."
