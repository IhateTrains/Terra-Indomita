 xiongnu_missions_01_DESCRIPTION: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] were the original masters of the #E Eastern Steppe#!, before the more famous Mongols millenia later. Over the course of but a few generations, the backwater clans in what is today #E Central Mongolia#!, went from unknown, squabbling nobodies to masters of the steppe, feared by all who knew them. The #E Turkic#! speaking elites led many in their confederation as they grew, integrating #E Indo-Iranians#!, #E Mongols#!, #E Uralians#!, #E Tocharians#!, #E Sino-Tibetans#!, #E Yeneisians#! and more across one hundred nations. This remarkable achievement was the result of the leadership of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] clan, and in particular, the original terror of the steppe, #E Modun#..."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_1_DESC: "The leadership of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] tribes is fractured and disorganized.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_2_DESC: "The blood of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] family has been chosen to lead our tribal confederation to glory over our neighbors, with the promise of the spoils of war.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_3_DESC: "Touman [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] has shown great promise as both a warrior and strong political leader.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_4_DESC: "Our brethren, the [GetCountry('AHO').GetName] tribes, have long vexed the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] by raiding our pasturelands and capturing our horses. It is time to unite them through conquest and bring the raids to an end."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_5_DESC: "The fabled [GetCountry('DLG').GetName] tribes are a northern nuisance, steadfastly independent and more adept to the harsh winters of #Y Lake Baikal#!.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_6: "Western Warmongering"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_6_DESC: "It is time to strike out westward to dominate the various clans that have long held political sway over our lands. The vast wealth of the #E kurgans#! built by our western brothers shall be ours!"

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_7_DESC: "What are we without horses? We must breed more and better horses if we ever hope to continue to dominate the steppe."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_8: "Early Steppe Stirrups"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_8_DESC: "While the origin of proto-stirrups have long been debated, it is without a doubt that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] hard-wood saddles contributed to the development and proliferation of technological developments that led to the stirrup we know today. Let us invest in the this equestrine technology, and all will fear the sound of our hooves."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_9: "Prairies and Pastures"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_9_DESC: "Raising livestock in the grasslands and pastures of the steppe is the backbone of our political and economic system. This cannot be ignored by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] political leadership."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_10: "Foreign Tribute"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_10_DESC: "We need to exact tribute from some of the lesser tribes to fuel our conquests across the steppe - before integrating their lands into our realm directly."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_11: "Capital Breeding Grounds"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_11_DESC: "Our growing seat of power at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is becoming an ever-important nexus of trade, as we have the best horses and pasturelands north of the #Y Gobi#!. We should invest in the maintenance of dedicated breeding grounds in and around our capital to spur economic activity and maintain our grip on the horse and livestock trade."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_12: "Southern Insults"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_12_DESC: "Our arch-rival, the [GetCountry('YEZ').GetName], have long been the greatest threat to our growing might.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_13: "Chanyu's Children"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_13_DESC: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] grows older, we must begin to think about the next generation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] leadership. The young Modun, born of one of #T Chanyu#! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s concubines, is strongly disfavored by the wife of the #T Chanyu#!. She will do wathever possible to secure the position of #T Chanyu#! for her own children at the expense of Modun."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_14: "The Mighty Modun"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_14_DESC: "Despite gaining the ire of the #T Chanyu#!'s wife, Modun, the son of one of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s concubines, is proving his worth as a fierce steppe warrior. His charisma is magnetic to the tribal elite, disrupting the plans of the #T Chanyu#! to secure the positions of his children born of his true wife. Perhaps he can be placated with some role within our tribal governance structure while a plan is hatched..."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_15: "Hollow Out Hujie"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_15_DESC: "The [GetCountry('HUJ').GetName] tribes sit at the doorstep of the vast western steppe lands, and have amassed considerable wealth at their #E kurgans#! over the centuries.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_16: "Jumping Jiankun"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_16_DESC: "The Samoyed speaking [GetCountry('JIK').GetName] peoples have long been trade and cultural partners in the greater #E Scytho-Siberian#! world. It is time we claim their vast wealth for ourselves and fold them into our confederation."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_17: "Control Gobi"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_17_DESC: "The #Y Gobi#! desert is both a vast wasteland and a highway to the riches of the #Y Yellow River#!. Controlling the routes through the #Y Gobi#! will allow for our raiding parties to reach further south and raid the rich lands of the #T Middle Kingdom#!."

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_18: "Ordos Expedition"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_18_DESC: "The most obvious first target across the #Y Gobi#! is the #Y Ordos Loop#!, a region of grasslands well-suited for nomadic herding and livestock breeding.

 xiongnu_missions_01_task_19: "Warn Wusun"
 xiongnu_missions_01_task_19_DESC: "The piddling [GetCountry('WUS').GetName] tribe, a lesser cousin of our [GetCountry('YEZ').GetName] rivals, cannot be allowed to interfere in our relations with the other steppe tribes. Let us ensure they won't, through 'diplomatic' means."

 me_xiongnu_01_2_desc: "My Chief [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], word has reached the court that we have the backing of the important chiefs and respected leaders in the confederation. There is no one left to challenge the name of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] from within!"

 me_xiongnu_01_3_desc: "Touman [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] has shown himself to be the greatest warrior of the upcoming generation. Of course by being a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], he enjoys the status and privelege of those that are part of the tribal elite, but he has also proven himself to be fearsome warrior, an adept strategist, a pious follower of #E Tengri#! and a cunning politician. He is the man that will lead the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] tribes, with horse and iron, to glorious victory!"
 me_xiongnu_01_3.a: "Touman will make a great Chanyu."

 me_xiongnu_01_4_title: "$xiongnu_missions_01_task_4$"
 me_xiongnu_01_4_desc: "Our rival brethen along the #E Anhou River#! have long evaded our grasp, casually raiding and stealing the livestock of our constituent clansmen for generations. The [GetCountry('AHO').GetName] did not expect for our clans to be united into a coherent polity under the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], and thus our tribe have been able to overcome theirs with the power of a focused strategy from the top, combined with the fearsome individual prowess of our horsemen. With booty in hand, we have thus absorbed the [GetCountry('AHO').GetName] tribesmen into our confederation and claim their wealth for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_xiongnu_01_4.a: "They stood no chance!"

 me_xiongnu_01_5_desc: "The [GetCountry('DLG').GetName] tribes were no match for the mighty horses of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Our forces conducted a brilliant ride-by-night raid against our enemy, led by our fearless leader [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Our trackers were able to extract information on enemy positions the day before by capturing a poor Dingling misadventurer as he rode his horse from their main camp, apparently seeking to ride south to petition for aid from our enemies. Now their camp lay in ruins, and the [GetCountry('DLG').GetName] armies completely shattered."
 me_xiongnu_01_5.a: "Their lands are now under our domain!"

The tribes to our west are home to kinsmen of many of the consituent clans of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and indeed many of our lifeways can be traced back to the cultural practices inherited from this region. Now as part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Confederation, our new subjects will contribute to the might of our armies, and the new areas can be exploited for their livestock and natural resources."
 me_xiongnu_01_6.a: "Our reach extends ever-westward..."

 me_xiongnu_01_7_title: "$xiongnu_missions_01_task_7$"
 me_xiongnu_01_7_desc: "O great [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], marvel at your efforts bearing fruit! Your wise judgment and commands led us toward investment in equestrian expansion and breeding. Now behold our vast stables of high quality horses, with which our growing armies will dominate the fields and plains of the steppe. The inferior tribes of the #E Hu#! to the east and the #E Scytho-Siberians#! to the west would do best to submit before our horses trample their bodies."
 me_xiongnu_01_7.a: "Let our horses gallop onward to crush our enemies!"

 me_xiongnu_01_8_title: "$xiongnu_missions_01_task_8$"
 me_xiongnu_01_8_desc: "After experimenting with various woods for creating harder saddles, one of our clansmen have discovered the perfect wood to use for this experimental design. Trade and conquest with lands to our west and south had turned up some of these new styles, but the ingenuity and curiosity of our people have found a way to more reliably reproduce these models for mass use by the army. The specimens will be ready for use by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] during out next campaign."
 me_xiongnu_01_8.a: "This will surely lead us to glory against our foes..."

As as result, the steppe economy is booming like never before, and less of the tribemen are at risk of famine. "

 me_xiongnu_01_10_desc: "The Chanyu [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that not all nations are ready to be administered directly by our tribal authority - in some circumstances these tribes were able to negotiate a degree of independence with the promise of annual tribute to the armies of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. This arrangement suits the Chanyu just fine at the moment, as it is less mouths to feed and care for, while still preparing us for further conquest through tribute."
 me_xiongnu_01_10.a: "Tribute from these vassals will continue to feed our war machine."

 me_xiongnu_01_11_title: "$xiongnu_missions_01_task_11$"
 me_xiongnu_01_11_desc: "My Lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]! Your latest scheme to increase the wealth of our seat of power has begun to pay off. The new capital breeding grounds have attracted horse traders from within and without the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Confederacy, bringing with them valuable economic activity and increasing the prestige of our capital. Our maintenance of these grounds will also ensure the armies of the #E Chanyu#! will have the best quality horses for future campaigns."

It is said that the ruler of their confederation spit on our envoys and forced them to ride on horseback, naked and without saddles, from their capital in the #E Barkol Grasslands#! all the way back to #E Longcheng#!.

The melee was fierce; the leaders of both armies hacking through lesser men to reach each other, ducking arrow fire as they rode deeper into battle. As they met face to face, a company of bodyguards came to surround the #E Chanyu#!, with arrows at the ready. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] dismounted and shielded himself with his horse, calling to #E Tengri#! for a miracle. At that moment, his left wing of cavalry collapsed the enemy right, and swung inward to wipe away the The [GetCountry('HUJ').GetName] bodyguards, and capture their commander. The battle had been won, and all spoke of the bravery of the #E Chanyu#! to ride so deep into the heart of the enemy."

Among the loot were ornate golden saddles and buckles, mysterious golden plaques of a sacred tree and beautuful gemstones supposedly from unknown kingdoms to the south and west. This gesture did not go unnoticed by the #E Chanyu#!, and the #E Samoyedic#! speaking constituent clans of the [GetCountry('JIK').GetName] would be spared total massacred, and instead be integrated into the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

Tales have reached their camps about the endless victories of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and the mericlessness toward those who resisted. While their shamans and elders debated what to do, the eldest shaman among them, a one-eyed crone who was blind and spoke but a few words per year, cried out 'To resist... is to kill us all, and extinguish your bloodlines; submit, and your childrens' children will live to fight gloriously alongside their kin.' The council then decided to allow the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to be their patrons, and provide supplies and manpower. The Wusun commander gawked at the ruling, and rode to challenge [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] in single combat, for the honor of his family and tribe.
