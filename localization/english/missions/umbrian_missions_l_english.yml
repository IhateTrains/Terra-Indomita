 umbria_mission_01_DESCRIPTION: "Locked away in the Hills of the Apennine range, the Umbrian tribes have long been a remote, rural people. Though we have occasionally allied against allied threats, it has generally been up to individual tribes or settlements to engage in skirmishes with outsiders, such as the antagonistic Etruscan cities.\n Now though, a #E militaristic state emerges#! from the Latin lowlands to our Southwest. \nIn these uncertain circumstances, the Umbrian tribes have once again joined under a grand alliance, united to extend our own will across the region. \n\n#E Let us cast down our threats, so that we, the Umbrians, may claim hegemony over Italia!#!"
 umbria_mission_01_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be complete when Umbria has freed the #E Italic#! tribes from the Latin yoke, and consolidated #E Italia#! into a single Umbrian #E Federation#!!"

 umbria_mission_task_6_DESC: "Now that we have smashed all Etruscan resistance to our rule, let us command our newest subjects to open up their coffers and treasuries - war is expensive, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has many bills that need to paid. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil2!"
