 zhongshan_missions: "The Crumbling Kingdom"
 zhongshan_missions_DESCRIPTION: "In the year 304BC, the state of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in utter disarray, facing erasure from the face of the earth by the hands of [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] and the #E Warring States#!. Not even a generation ago our state was relatively intact, participating in a #E Vertical Alliance#! of states to combat [GetCountry('QIN').GetName)], and even claiming the title of King, just as the other states in the #E Middle Kingdom#!. However, after the failure of the campaigns against #E Qin#!, #E Zhao#! resumed hostilities in 307BC, swiftly overwhelming our much smaller kingdom. With hardly any territory left to defend against the #E Zhao#! onslaught, we will need a miracle to survive."
 zhongshan_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the #E Zhao#! threat has been defeated and #E Zhongshan#! has decided between its ancestral ways or sinicizing."
 zhongshan_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "If we do not act, there soon will be no independent Zhongshan."

 #Missions

 zhongshan_missions_task_1: "Repairing Defenses"
 zhongshan_missions_task_1_DESC: "If we are to have any hope of defeating the [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] and stopping the freefall of our state, we must immediately invest in the repairing our remaining defenses, lest our final strongholds be gobbled up by the hungry #E Warring States#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@event_pic7!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_2: "Petition Qi"
 zhongshan_missions_task_2_DESC: "The [GetCountry('QII').GetName)] are the second most powerful state in the #E Middle Kingdom#!, and some say their culture and capital of #E Linzi#! is the most venerable in all the world. We need to petition the great kings of [GetCountry('QII').GetName)] to come to our aid against the accursed [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_3: "Promoting The Di"
 zhongshan_missions_task_3_DESC: "The #E Di#! peoples migrated to #E China#! in the last several centuries, being forced east by the ever-changing political landscape of the unforgiving steppe, and in particular the [GetCountry('QII').GetName)] Confederation. As the various #E Di#! tribes attempted to make a life in the hills regions north of the #Y Yellow River#!, the #E Baidi#! in the east chose to blend with the #E Huaxia#! peoples, creating the semi-barbarian state of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The sinicized nobles currently promote the #E Ji#!, foresaking our numerous #E Baidi#! brothers. Let these two cultues become equals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@italic_mil3!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_4: "Destabilizing Zhao"
 zhongshan_missions_task_4_DESC: "The [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] resent our autonomy and seek to centralize their authority. We must counteract these efforts and - with the support of Zhao's newly acquired tribal vassals - lead a general revolt against their king.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_5: "Hufu Riding And Archery"
 zhongshan_missions_task_5_DESC: "A couple of years ago, [GetCharacter('(int32)621').GetName] of Zhao started to no longer look at the #E Di#! tribesman in #E Loufan#! as backward nuisances, but as a source of inspiration for his military. These tribesman are our ancestors but due to decadence we have neglected to train in this style for the past decades. If we want to hold our ground against the Zhao, we have to again train like the wild barbarian who must be made of steel to survive in the badlands to the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil1!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_6: "Befriending Qi"
 zhongshan_missions_task_6_DESC: "[GetCountry('QII').GetName)] has already proven a great deterrent to [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] my king, allowing us the breathing room to get [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] back in the game. Perhaps it is time for royal line of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] to offer their hand in marriage to King [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName] of [GetCountry('QII').GetName)], cementing our burgeoning alliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_7: "Honor Ancestors"
 zhongshan_missions_task_7_DESC: "Our forefathers who brought us to these lands deserve a greater offering than modest burials and shrines we have dedicated to their memory. Let us celebrate their briliance by constucting a grand #E Holy Site#! in [GetProvince('(int32)8686').GetName] and consecrating relics in their honor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil8!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_8: "Carve Up Zhao"
 zhongshan_missions_task_8_DESC: "We are as prepared as we can be to begin the liberation of the #E Di#! peoples against [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)]. Let us claim the core tribal regions so recently secured by the Kings of [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)], and bring their oppressed peoples to our banner!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil17!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_9: "Deal With Yan"
 zhongshan_missions_task_9_DESC: "While [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] is without a doubt the worst aggressor, we cannot forget the transgressions of [GetCountry('YAN').GetName)], who have also taken opportunities over the years to pillage our northeastern border. While we had once come close to ridding ourselves of the threat of #E Yan#! in 315BC with the help of [GetCountry('QII').GetName)], their ultimate destruction eluded us and they have rebounded. It is time to finish the job this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_10: "Steppe Heritage"
 zhongshan_missions_task_10_DESC: "The #E Baidi#! peoples within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] still feel a nostalgia and longing for the way of the horse. And indeed, remembering our near-forgotten past may come with benefits, as there are many potential allies in the steppelands, and a vast pool of manpower to draw from to wage our wars in the #Middle Kingdom#!.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil5!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_11: "Silver Winged Beasts"
 zhongshan_missions_task_11_DESC: "The great artists of the realm, gathered in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], have proposed their latest visions of grandeur for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Not to be outdone by the culturally preeminent [GetCountry('QII').GetName)], a schematic for the creation of opulent silver-winged beasts was proposed to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. While expensive, it could be worth it... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_12: "Fall Of Zhao"
 zhongshan_missions_task_12_DESC: "The time has finally come, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. With allies in tow, and our core lands liberated from the menacing [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)], we are finally in position to avenge our fallen and enslaved kinsmen of the last generation. [GetCountry('ZHA').GetRuler.GetName] must pay for the transgressions of their genocidal nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_13: "Exploit Tin and Copper Mines"
 zhongshan_missions_task_13_DESC: "While iron is becoming the hottest thing since soft silk, #Y bronze#! still holds immense value for both the military and the culturalpractices of the entire region. Perhaps if we are able to better exploit the metal mines, we could create a new fabulous weapon for ceremony and war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_14: "Tame The Steppe"
 zhongshan_missions_task_14_DESC: "The great steppe presents both opporunity and challenge for us, o King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. The vast plains offers innumerable horses and cattle, as well as tribal warriors whose rage we could direct to our #E Huaxia#! enemies. However, taming the unruly and independent-minded peoples of this vast area is no easy task, and risk raids against out country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_15: "Return To The Steppe"
 zhongshan_missions_task_15_DESC: "Our time amongst the #E Huaxia#! peoples has been tumultuous. Though we have been here for centuries, they have never truly accepted our presence, despite adopting many of their customs and being a player in the political affairs of the #E Middle Kingdom#!. Perhaps it is time we consider a return to our roots by remounting our abandoned steeds and once more riding out onto the steppe, leaving civilization behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil9!"

 zhongshan_missions_task_16: "Our Next Stop Is China"
 zhongshan_missions_task_16_DESC: "With our northern flank secure and our baneful rival [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] routed, we can now look to become the preeminent power in the #E Middle Kingdom#!! Let us plunge deep into the #Y Wei#! and #Y Yellow River#! Valleys, and make our claim to the title #E Son of Heaven#! through conquest of the remaining #E Warring States#!. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil15!"

 me_zhongshan_1_desc: "Our architects, with enough resources, have restored the crumbling walls of our final strongholds and brought a light of hope to our embattled populace. The stentch of our recent defeats is finally fading, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can now catch its breath."
 me_zhongshan_1.a: "Our fortifications are restored!"
 
 me_zhongshan_100_title: "$zhongshan_missions_task_1$"
 me_zhongshan_100_desc: "While King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had hoped the repairs would be ahead of schedule and under budget, in reality, this is almost never the case. As our engineers were rebuilding a part of the damaged southern wall at [GetProvince('(int32)8686').GetName], a portion of the rampart collapsed, killing dozens of laborers and setting the project back in both time and resources. Worse yet, a number of men quit the job, citing the lack of safety standards and fear of being crushed by falling stones."

They begged the lord for any aid they could provide, but most of all sought a guarantee from the king that they would commit their forces against [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] should they attempt to absorb us. [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName] indulged our proposition, and hosted a feast for our emissaries, before sending them back to [GetProvince('(int32)8686').GetName] with the assurance that they will be protected."
 me_zhongshan_2.a: "Qii will save us."
 
 me_zhongshan_200_title: "Petition From Zhongshan"
 me_zhongshan_200_desc: "The crumbling statelet of [GetCountry('ZHS').GetName)] has sent a final plea to our King, [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName], for protection against our mutual rival [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)]. They have long proven an excellent distraction for the #E Zhao#! lords, keep their minds off of the lands of [GetCountry('WII').GetName)]. This is an opporunity we cannot pass up, and this will be the final chance."
 me_zhongshan_200.a: "Zhongshan will be protected."

 me_zhongshan_3_title: "$zhongshan_missions_task_3$"
 me_zhongshan_3_desc: "The #E Ji#! nobles had long resisted the ascension of #E Baidi#! tribal elites from equal status among the halls of the royal palace at [GetProvince('(int32)8686').GetName]. And while resentment still remains, the existential crisis of the loss of most of the territory of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and with it the wealth that once flowed to the nobles, has compelled the #E Ji#! to finally relinquish their status as the only nobility in our courts. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decreed, after the latest council of nobles, to finally grant equal status to the #E Baidi#!!"
 me_zhongshan_3.a: "The Baidi elite are now equals to the Ji nobles."

 me_zhongshan_4_title: "$zhongshan_missions_task_4$"
 me_zhongshan_4_desc: "Our tribal spies have successfully infiltrated the enemies camps, and reached the royals tents of the tribal lords of #E Linhu#!, #E Loufan#! and #E Hezongshi#!. The spies at first blended into the main horde, and began sowing discontent about their subjugation by the [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] to the tribesmen around the campfires each night. As wounds were reopened and hatred turned into riot in the tribal camps, the leaders of the three tribal tributaries were persuaded by our spies to reach out to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and hatch a plan to throw off the #E Zhao#! yoke. Should we declare war now, at this most opportune time?"
 me_zhongshan_4.a: "We will crush Zhao!"
 me_zhongshan_4.b: "We cannot risk open warfare now."

 me_zhongshan_5_title: "$zhongshan_missions_task_5$"
 me_zhongshan_5_desc: "When [baidi_marshal.GetName] made the suggestion to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that our horsemen again start wearing the old clothing styles of our #E Di#! ancestors, there was a great deal of pushback from the Chinese elements at court who abhorred the open embrace of such strange behaviors\n\nAnd yet once [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had been convinced, there was no going back. [baidi_marshal.GetName] was certain that our military forces would benefit, and the wise Marshal was soon proven to be correct. We now again excel as riders, and our clothes are well-suited to maneuvering on horseback.\n\nThe Zhao and all of China will now feel the dealy spears of our mounted levies..."
 me_zhongshan_5.a: "The riders of Zhongshan are coming!"

 me_zhongshan_6_title: "A Royal Marriage"
 me_zhongshan_6_desc: "What began as a relationship our necessity for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and simple geopolitical strategy for [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName] has now turned into a budding friendship between two nations with so many common foes. The heir of King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is to be married to the one of the princesses of [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName] to validate the bonds of comraderie between our two countries, and together we will vanquish our foes in the #E Middle Kingdom#!."
 me_zhongshan_6.a: "Our marriage-alliance is secure!"
 
 me_zhongshan_600_title: "A Zhongshan Bride"
 me_zhongshan_600_desc: "Our nascent friendship and patronage of the Kingdom of [GetCountry('ZHS').GetName)] has proven useful in curtailing the ambitions of our enemies to the west and north, [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] and [GetCountry('YAN').GetName)]. With the ever-changing nature of alliances in the #E Middle Kingdom#!, we should exchange princesses with their royal house, and bring a new #E Zhongshan#! bride to court in [GetProvince('(int32)8504').GetName] to secure their loyalties."
 me_zhongshan_600.a: "Let us celebrate this consecration!"

 me_zhongshan_7_title: "$zhongshan_missions_task_7$"
 me_zhongshan_7_desc: "As the new great holy site in our capital of [GetProvince('(int32)8686').GetName] was ceremoniously unveiled, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] stood upon the entryway waving to the crowds. The people cheered and began to sing songs in honor of their ancestors, and hailing the king and his great architects. At that moment, the king had commemorative funerary decorations made of bronze brought forth to show off to the masses. This caused a sensation, and a holiday with feasts was subsequently declared for three days in honor of all of the spirits of the ancestors of [GetCountry('ZHS').GetName)]."

Gone are the days where we fear the power of [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)], as your mighty sword chased their broken armies from the battlefields. Our warriors sing of how you led the men headlong into the vast forces of the enemy, cleaving their infantry in two and bravely blunting the enemies counter-charge. The liberation of these many territories through your adept strategy and personal bravery will be celebrated by all in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], o Great King!"

 me_zhongshan_9_desc: "The armies of [GetCountry('YAN').GetName)] had attempted to set an ambush on the road to [GetProvince('(int32)8742').GetName], but our allies in [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName] knew the terrain of the region well, as they had frequently fought against their northern rival. #E Qi#! spies sent word to King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] of the trap, and he made a last minute change to split the army in two, in an attempt to then circle around the positions given to us by our allies. The #E Qi#! information proved correct, and the would be ambushers were completely taken aback as the armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] conducted a brilliant pincer maneuver from the left and right rear. A token force of foot soldiers was also sent into the frontal position the #E Qi#! infrantry had expected the entire army to be in, which served as a hammer to the anvil cavalry charges in the rear. The armies of #E Yan#! were broken, and their heartland seized by the great #E Zhongshan#!!"
