 han_warring_missions_DESCRIPTION: "The inhabitants of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] were influential powerbrokers within the state of #E Jin#! and were ultimately contributors to its #E Partition#!. Ever since those first pivotal moments wherein we established the kingdom that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] now rules over, our kinsmen have conquered and succeeded against much stronger foes, who have fatally dismissed us as backwards hill dwellers.\n\nAlthough we have had storied successes in the past - we once annexed the state of #E Zheng#! and took their capital as our own - we have also suffered recent defeats that tarnish the legacy of the ruling [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] family. It remains to be seen if Han will survive the many wars that have seized the #E Middle Kingdom#!, as it sits in a precarious position and cannot trust its neighbors to be true to their word."
