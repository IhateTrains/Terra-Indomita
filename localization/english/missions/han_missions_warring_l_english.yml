 han_warring_missions_task_1_DESC: "It makes sense for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to curry favor with the #E Emperor#! living in [GetProvince('(int32)8379').GetName]; once we have raised their opinions of us, the prestige that we shall gain from a harmonious relationship will be well worth the cost. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 han_warring_missions_task_2: "Partition Chu"

 han_warring_missions_task_4: "Coalition Qin"
 han_warring_missions_task_4_DESC: "The aggressive foreign policy of [GetCountry('QIN').GetName)] is a threat to everyone and has earned them no friends.

 han_warring_missions_task_5: "Protect Northern Commanderies"
 han_warring_missions_task_5_DESC: "It would be foolish to leave our northern flank exposed, without proper fortifications to slow the advance of an invading army. The time has come to build a fortress that will protect the northern commanderies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil14!"

 han_warring_missions_task_6: "Old City Of Zheng And Han"
 han_warring_missions_task_6_DESC: "Our capital city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has a storied history, for it was once the capital of the #E Zheng#! before our ancestors overthrew them and assumed their authority. Such an ancient place deserves to be beautified and expanded upon. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

 han_warring_missions_task_7_DESC: "There is strength to be found in the #Y Legalist#! School of Thought, and we happen to have a brilliant scholar in our midst - a philosophically-minded prince named #E Han Fei#!. Perhaps we could persuade this young man to come offer his services at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

 han_warring_missions_task_8: "Dismantle Qin"
 han_warring_missions_task_8_DESC: "Slowly but surely, we are pushing back the [GetCountry('QIN').GetName)]. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been relentless, ordering the armies to press the attack and to not allow the Qin to catch their footing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

 han_warring_missions_task_9: "Backstab Wei"
 han_warring_missions_task_9_DESC: "Although we once worked together with both [GetCountry('WEI').GetName)] and [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName)] to depose the wicked kings of #E Jin#!, the Partition happened a long time ago and things have changed.

 han_warring_missions_task_11: "Distract Qin"
 han_warring_missions_task_11_DESC: "We have heard that the [GetCountry('QIN').GetName)] enjoy working on large scale architectural projects - all in service to the ego of [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetName)], undoubtedly. Perhaps it might make sense to suggest a large project in order to keep them busy? We much prefer their soldiers to be working in the fields and not amassing at our border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 han_warring_missions_task_12: "Han Feizi"
 han_warring_missions_task_12_DESC: "#E Han Fei#! has been busy lately, compiling his thoughts and distilling them into essay form; it is said that he is working on a manuscript, one that will touch upon a wide manner of subjects.

 han_warring_missions_task_13: "Southern Jin"
 han_warring_missions_task_13_DESC: "We must defeat our neighboring states if we have any hopes of restoring #E Jin#! - a dream that once seemed impossible and yet is closer than ever before.

 han_warring_missions_task_15_DESC: "The #T Yellow River#! is the main artery of our country, affording us the ability to travel quickly, import foodstuffs and other delicacies, and irrigate our fields. We must take advantage of this natural waterway and build farms alongside the river, for the armies of [GetCountry('HAN').GetName)] are growing rapidly and they have large appetites! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

It is rumored that the King has locked himself inside of [GetCountry('CHU').GetCapital.GetName)] and is drowning his frustrations with wine."

 me_han_warring_6_title: "$han_warring_missions_task_6$"
 me_han_warring_6_desc: "The old city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is ancient indeed, for it used to be the capital of the state of #E Zheng#!.The Zheng thrived for centuries, but they made poor choices in the game of politics and were battered about by various principalties, like the #E Jin#!, before our own ancestors destroyed their House forevermore.\n\nWhen our kingdom was decreed on that day, our forebears kept the capital where it was, but over the last seventy or so years, the need for infrastructure improvements has become more and more clear.\n\nBut this is a problem that has been solved by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who did not rest until the capital was expanded and reinvigorated.

 me_han_warring_9_desc: "It was said that when the people of [GetCountry('WEI').GetName)] first heard the news that [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetName)] had prepared claims on their territory en masse, [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetSheHe)] was cursed as a fairweather friend and backstabber, but [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)] seems unbothered by the insults. When asked how [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetSheHe)] could prepare for war against our former partners, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] laughed callously, causing the entire court of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to echo [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mirth."

 me_han_warring_10_desc: "When a brilliant young engineer showed up at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] with elaborate plans for a #E Grand Canal#! that would be built along the #E Guanzhong Plain#!, [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetName)] asked this man, #E Zheng Guo#!, to meet with [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetHerHim)] personally in order to explain the designs.\n\nA couple of hours later, [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)] was convinced of the necessity to construct such canals and, impressed by Zheng's demeanor and confidence in his own ability, [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetSheHe)] hired him on the spot."
 me_han_warring_10.a: "Welcome to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], your new home..."

 me_han_warring_11_title: "$han_warring_missions_task_11$"
 me_han_warring_11_desc: "'This is a most excellent idea...an intriguing one, at that. A canal to irrigate lands that currently cannot support agriculture...hmm. But why have you not built such a thing yourself, my brother? Surely the vegetable markets at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] could be better stocked than they are?'\n\n[GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetName)] leaned back on [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetHerHis)] chair, casting an inquisitive look at [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetName)], who had invited [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetHerHis)] illustrious guest over for a discussion about a large-scale infrastructure project.\n\n'I would if I had the means and funds to do so, dear brother. Unfortunately for me, there are no master architects living in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that could handle such a big job.' [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)] smiled weakly, noticing the look of contempt on his partner's face. The Qin truly think that the people of Han are inferior to them, and by playing to [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)]'s pride, the Han [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] was about pull the wool over the King's eyes. 'Such a task requires a magnificence that I currently lack, and truthfully, only one name came to mind - yours, [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)].'\n\nThe Qin King cackled and slapped both knees. 'Very well, then. I suppose that we shall start the construction ourselves. The Jing and Luo River should be connected, after all - you are right.' As the Qin ruler rose to [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetHerHis)] feet, [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetSheHe)] gave [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)] a look of pity.\n\n'Don't expect anything in manner of compensation for this, by the way.'\n\nGritting [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] teeth, [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetFirstName)] bowed deeply in order to hide the twinkle in [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetHerHis)] eyes - what fools the Qin are."
