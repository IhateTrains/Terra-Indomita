 yan_missions_DESCRIPTION: "All around us, the twin promises of death and subjugation; whether delivered at the hands of an ambitious southern King or brought alongside a vast steppe horde army from the northern wastelands, only the gods know. Yet it is clear that #E Yan#! faces a dark and treacherous road ahead, with few friends to walk alongside us.\n\nWhile some would tremble in the face of such daunting odds of survival, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] scoffs at the danger, secure in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] vision for the future. While many of the kingdoms around us fall to the wayside, destroyed by internal dissension and foreign wars of aggression, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] stands alone - Yan will not succumb to the darkness, but will rise above it all!"

 me_yan_1904_desc: "It has been weeks since anyone has heard from Ke Jing, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is starting to fear for the worst. Although the Yan [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] was bracing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]self for bad news, when it finally came, it still caused [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to tremble in fear.\n\nSimply put, the assassination attempt was a complete, embarrassing failure. Ke Jing and Qin Wuyang acted like country bumpkins at court, wandering around wide-eyed and open-mouthed as they gawped at the splendor around them. To make matters worse, Qin Wuyang was apparently sweating like a mare in labor, soaking his clothes and raising the suspicions of the Qin guards, who refused to allow him in the presence of [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetName].\n\nRealizing that the ruse was up, Ke Jing at least attempted to strike down [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetFirstName], and it is said that he chased the Qin King, knife in hand, as he tried to hide behind a pillar - an almost comical scene.\n\nMoments later, Ke's head would be split in half by Qin soldiers, and the broken bodies of both Ke and Qin are hanging outside the main gates of [GetCountry('QIN').GetCapital.GetName].\n\nNeedless to say, the Qin are incredibly angry at us..."

 me_yan_1906_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], your spies have caught two noblemen from [GetCountry('YAN').GetName] attempting to infiltrate our court. They claimed to have the head of a Qin rebel, #E Fan Wuqi#!, and asked if they could present it to your Majesty. But these were lies, as the poisoned dagger in their possession revealed. The two simpletons tried to smuggle the weapon inside the Palace by hiding it in a scroll box - how stupid do they think we are?\n\nThe executioner was sent for, and as the two men suffered the death of a thousand cuts, they told us everything; they were sent by [GetCountry('YAN').GetRuler.GetName] in hopes of destabilizing our country, for they admit that they have no hopes of victory on the battlefield and must resort to skullduggery to achieve their foul goals.\n\nThankfully, our guards handled this situation before it got out of hand, but we thought that you should know that you have many foes."
