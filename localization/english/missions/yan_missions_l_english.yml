 yan_missions_task_1_DESC: "If [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has any hopes of becoming a mighty nation, one that is both respected and feared by our rivals, then we must be guided by ministers with vision, men of bold action - we cannot afford to allow advisors of weak character to assume positions of power.\n\nThankfully, there are those who are willing to give their lives in service to the people, and Guo Wei is one of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil8!"

 yan_missions_task_2: "Rebuild Southern Yan"
 yan_missions_task_2_DESC: "The land that borders our enemies to the south has seen its fair share of calamities, but the time has come for us to focus our resources on rebuilding; there is much that we could do to improve our infrastructure in this war-devastated region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

 yan_missions_task_3: "A Prized Hostage"
 yan_missions_task_3_DESC: "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], the most miraculous thing has happened; a Yan general that was sent to the lands of the #E Donghu#! as a hostage has escaped the clutches of those barbarians, returning to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] with valuable information about our enemies and their way of life. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil8!"

 yan_missions_task_4: "Recruit Foreign Talents"
 yan_missions_task_4_DESC: "We must send out word far and wide that the Royal Court in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has need for men of talent - our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] will pay the salaries for those willing to come serve the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 yan_missions_task_5: "Anti-Qi Alliance"
 yan_missions_task_5_DESC: "We cannot defeat the [GetCountry('QII').GetName] by ourselves, and we will not even make the attempt unless we have allies- we need friends that will have our backs when the time for war is at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

 yan_missions_task_6: "Iron and Bronze Metallurgy"
 yan_missions_task_6_DESC: "While we have iron and bronze available to us in the mountains, it will be of no use to our blacksmiths unless we have built mines - our hungry nation has need of these valuable metals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil6!"

 yan_missions_task_7: "By Ji"
 yan_missions_task_7_DESC: "The beautiful city of #E Ji#! stands above all others and yet there is room for the growth of our fair capital - it could become the greatest metropolis in all of the Middle Kingdom, especially if guided by one with vision. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"

 yan_missions_task_8: "Defeat Donghu"
 yan_missions_task_8_DESC: "The savage tribes of [GetCountry('DGH').GetName] have sent their raiding parties into our hills and forests for the last time - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will put an end to these barbarians once and for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil7!"

 yan_missions_task_9: "Defend Against Zhao"
 yan_missions_task_9_DESC: "The kingdom of [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName] has long been a thorn in the side of our people; an intractable enemy that we can never afford to ignore, lest they take advantage of any situation that they can exploit. Let us build fortresses that will serve as the first line of defense against our rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 yan_missions_task_10: "Quell Qi"
 yan_missions_task_10_DESC: "The rich cities of [GetCountry('QII').GetName] are seductively calling out to our levies, who are desperate to plunder the homes of the soft southerners. Once we have defeated their armies, we shall unleash our forces against the heartlands of Qi, allowing them to gorge themselves until their bellies are full. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil3!"

 yan_missions_task_11: "Royal Bronzeware"
 yan_missions_task_11_DESC: "Now that we have the financial means to do so, we should commission bronzes that reflect the status of the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], the greatest rulers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to have ever sat upon its jeweled throne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil12!"

 yan_missions_task_12: "Seize Joseon"
 yan_missions_task_12_DESC: "Now that the strength of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is resurgent, let us push to the east and seize as much of [GetCountry('JSN').GetName] as we can. We have reason to believe that the barbarians will crumble before our victorious forces - the gods have given their lands over to us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil1!"

 yan_missions_task_13: "Push Back Zhao"
 yan_missions_task_13_DESC: "In our hearts, we know that we will never be able to peacefully live alongside [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName] - our people will only be safe once their menacing levies are pushed far back from our borders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

 yan_missions_task_14: "Treasures of Qi"
 yan_missions_task_14_DESC: "Some people repeat the foolish story that [GetProvince('(int32)8504').GetName], once the capital of the [GetCountry('QII').GetName], is the greatest city in the world, surpassing even our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] in glory and prestige. These wagging tongues will be silenced, however, once they hear that we have taken the most valuable treasures of Qi for ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@egypt_mil19!"

 yan_missions_task_15: "March South"
 yan_missions_task_15_DESC: "Now that the heartlands of [GetCountry('QII').GetName] have fallen into our hands, then there is not much preventing us from further expanding to our south - command our soldiers to march for the capitals of our enemies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil2!"

 yan_missions_task_16: "Maritime Trade"
 yan_missions_task_16_DESC: "There is potential in the province of [GetProvince('(int32)8724').GetName] that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has seen, and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has declared that this region will become the home to a magnificent port, one that shall control maritime trade in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil8!"

 yan_missions_task_18: "Jin Puppets"
 yan_missions_task_18_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is said to have [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] fingers pulling many strings, with spies and informers all throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] sending clandestine messages back to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

 yan_missions_task_19: "The Emperor and the Assassin"
 yan_missions_task_19_DESC: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is not afraid to utilize any means at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] disposal to achieve [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] political goals, especially when it comes to protecting the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil15!"


 #Events
 me_yan_1_title: "$yan_missions_task_1$"
 me_yan_1_desc: "Although many advisors had hoped to catch the ear of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] was not interested in the fawning words of sycophants that would tell [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] everything that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] wanted to hear. Only the honest word of a true servant would suffice, and yet everyone standing before the throne only sought to enrich themselves or change their status at court.\n\nAfter many hours of listening to the speeches of fools, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] called forth #E Wei Guo#! to stand before the King, asking the minister what was the best step forward for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\n'Seek the counsel of learned men first and let it be known that you value knowledge, and sages far wiser than I shall appear at your doorstep'."
 me_yan_1.a: "I hope what you say is true, [SCOPE.sCharacter('guo_character').GetFirstName]..."

 me_yan_2_title: "$yan_missions_task_2$"
 me_yan_2_desc: "We have received word, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], that the infrastructure projects that we have undertaken in the west have come to fruition. Everyone passing through these regions proclaim that good times have returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and that the gods have blessed the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]. Surely our prosperity is a sign of things to come!"
 me_yan_2.a: "This is most auspicious news, indeed"

 me_yan_3_title: "$yan_missions_task_3$"
 me_yan_3_desc: "A story so incredible that it defies belief has been making the rounds in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], determined to discover what the truth is, has finally managed to get to the bottom of everything, and what they say is true!\n\nYears ago, there was a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warrior named #E Kai Qin#! that was sent as a hostage to a tribe of the [GetCountry('DGH').GetName], and it was widely believed that Kai would never return home, for the Donghu are a people without honor - they regularly violate their oaths, and yet we had no choice at the time. Kai was forced to leave all that he knew to become the thrall of a barbarian warlord - truly, a miserable fate.\n\nAnd yet it appears that Kai managed to escape his captors after many years wandering the steppes and the badlands in the north, and he has returned to his country with intimate knowledge of the lands of our enemies. Upon returning to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], Kai went home to visit his family, but the command of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] brought the escapee to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."
 me_yan_3.a: "I want detailed maps of everything that Kai Qin has seen"

 me_yan_4_title: "$yan_missions_task_4$"
 me_yan_4_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] knew that the famous warlord #E Ju Xin#! was heading for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] long before the warrior reached the city gates, for word traveled quickly along the highways and roads of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] of the general's passing.\n\nIt came as a relief to hear that this esteemed tactician was there to lend his services to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], for there were murmurings that some calamity was accompanying this deadly soldier."
 me_yan_4.a: "May victory ride with you, Ju Xin, and with us"
 
 me_yan_400_title: "$yan_missions_task_4$"
 me_yan_400_desc: "Remembering the words of Wei Guo, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] sent forth messengers all throughout the cities and crossroads of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], proclaiming that the mighty [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] would pay gold and silver to men of talent that would be willing to serve the state.\n\nIt came as no surprise, then, when a scholar of some renown named #E Yan Zou#! appeared at the gates of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], with nothing to his name save the tattered cloak on his back and an empty rice bowl that he carried in both hands.\n\nRaising the bowl above his head, Yan yelled out in a loud voice that he would soon eat at the side of the King, so great was his desire to serve [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] - he promised to prove himself through hard work and would settle for nothing less than a seat at the royal table."
 me_yan_400.a: "I have heard your name, Yan Zou...and we shall see about that!"
 
 me_yan_401_title: "$yan_missions_task_4$"
 me_yan_401_desc: "As word spread far and wide of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s interest in recruiting foreign talent, another sage, a philosopher and general named #E Yi Yue#!, made the journey to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to offer his sword to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], but with a catch.\n\n'We shall fight if we must, but in my many years of wandering, I have learned that the importance of friendship. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] needs allies if we are to triumph in the days ahead, and I promise that I will help to achieve this!'"
 me_yan_401.a: "'We', eh? I like how you're thinking, though..."

 me_yan_5_title: "$yan_missions_task_5$"
 me_yan_5_desc: "'My esteemed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], do not think that I do not know what you are doing - although you attempt to conceal your hissing, I know you to be a viper, a snake that will be trampled underfoot by the armies of [GetCountry('QII').GetName] and shall one day have its head cut off.'\n\nThus began the message from [GetCountry('QII').GetRuler.GetName], and it only progressively got worse from there - the insults that were heaped at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] were unrepeatable in polite society, and the cheeks of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] flushed in rage as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] listened to the stream of curses.\n\n'Enough!' [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] barked, rising to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] feet. 'If Qi wants war, then they shall have it!'"
 me_yan_5.a: "How bold of you, to threaten me and my allies in this manner!"

 me_yan_6_title: "$yan_missions_task_6$"
 me_yan_6_desc: "Our slaves have been working hard in the mines, and yet even their ceaseless, backbreaking labor is barely enough to feed the hungry forges and smiths of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people.\n\nThe overseers tasked with watching these wretched souls, their coinpurses jingling with silver, continue to push the slaves to their limits, knowing that the need for iron and bronze is only growing."
 me_yan_6.a: "We have a growing army that we must equip with the finest weaponry"

 me_yan_7_title: "$yan_missions_task_7$"
 me_yan_7_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], the capital of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], is the largest growing region in all of the lands held by the Yan, surpassing its original borders and becoming a metropolis that rivals the greatest cities of the world - what an accomplishment for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who has overseen this unprecedented expansion.\n\nMany travel from afar for the chance to get lost wandering through the cacophony of Ji's commercial districts, or perhaps spending a quiet afternoon in one of its many tea shops, listening to the gurgling waters of a nearby stream as they contemplate the day."
 me_yan_7.a: "The best days of Ji remain before us, dear citizens...count on it"

 me_yan_8_title: "$yan_missions_task_8$"
 me_yan_8_desc: "When the levies of [GetCountry('YAN').GetName] first encountered the savages from [GetCountry('DGH').GetName] on the battlefield, it is said that their cowardly forces became so disoriented and confused that they began to attack each other in their rush to escape the armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who seized the advantage and pressed our men forward, scattering all resistance.\n\nWhat followed next could be described as slaughter, and now the greedy crows gorge themselves on the flesh of Donghu horses and men."
 me_yan_8.a: "Ever forward, soldiers of Yan! To victory!"

 me_yan_9_title: "$yan_missions_task_9$"
 me_yan_9_desc: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] would prefer to meet the soldiers of [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName] on the battlefield, the ambitious [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] cannot be everywhere at once, and there oftentimes events in the north and east of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] that require [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention.\n\nNot wishing to cede control of the western hinterlands uncontested, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has commanded that fortifications be built in the provinces - the first line of defense against the encroaching Zhao hordes."
 me_yan_9.a: "We shall not let them cross into our heartlands without a fight!"

 me_yan_10_title: "$yan_missions_task_10$"
 me_yan_10_desc: "What a dark day for the [GetCountry('QII').GetName] - did the gods see fit to warn their people that their day of judgment was at hand? Where were the prophets, carrying the words of warning upon their lips? But now it is too late, and the mournful song of desolation fills the smoke-filled air of the burning provinces.\n\nThe forces of [GetCountry('YAN').GetName] have cast the treacherous Qi from their core lands - even the legendary city of [GetProvince('(int32)8504').GetName], their pride and joy, has fallen to the Yan armies, who now fly the banner of the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] above its damaged ramparts. The Qi will never be able to recover from such a devastating loss, and their days are truly numbered."
 me_yan_10.a: "I shall show them no mercy, but shall press on to their doom!"

 me_yan_11_title: "$yan_missions_task_11$"
 me_yan_11_desc: "In a generous display, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has commissioned a set of #E Royal Bronzewares#! to be constructed by the master metalworkers living in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].\n\nIt is the hope of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] that the common people will praise the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] for its largesse."
 me_yan_11.a: "Our civilization is thriving, growing in prestige every day"

 me_yan_12_title: "$yan_missions_task_12$"
 me_yan_12_desc: "News from the front! Our triumphant levies have driven back the weak forces of [GetCountry('JSN').GetName], seizing the valuable peninsula that controls the flow of trade in and out of the #E Sinus Bohai#!.\n\nThe omens have spoken, all but guaranteeing eternal victory for the armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], whom the gods have seen fit to make into a mighty conqueror!"
 me_yan_12.a: "There are more battles that we will fight together - are you with me?"

 me_yan_13_title: "$yan_missions_task_13$"
 me_yan_13_desc: "With our fortifications against [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName] complete, we are now able to strike against our enemies from a position of strength, and the gods have rewarded the brilliant strategems of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] by giving us large swathes of their territory.\n\nOur levies are grateful, knowing that in the worst case scenario, they will be able to fall back to the fortresses that we have built in our western territories, but for now, the occupation of Zhao will continue."
 me_yan_13.a: "And yet they shall continue to march forward..."

 me_yan_14_title: "$yan_missions_task_14$"
 me_yan_14_desc: "In a display of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] superiority against our fallen enemies, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has issued the fateful command that the treasures of [GetProvince('(int32)8504').GetName] must be relocated to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. Even now, as the wailing of the shocked citizens fills the streets of Linzi, our soldiers are methodically emptying the shrines of their holy objects.\n\nThe vengeful [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] did not listen to the heartfelt pleas of the Qi elites that desperately begged to keep their sacred treasures, arguing that this move would break the spirit of their countrymen forever."
 me_yan_14.a: "That is the intention..."

 me_yan_15_title: "$yan_missions_task_15$"
 me_yan_15_desc: "The lands held by the [GetCountry('QII').GetName] have been all but been ruined, and plague and famine have quickly swept through the broken lands that were recently occupied by the Yan armies. The peasants of the region, hoping that the worst days are over for them, are quietly trying to rebuild their broken lives, struggling to pay the local indemnities that the newly-installed Yan overseers are demanding.\n\nWhere there once stood a bustling village, full of life and people, only the harsh cawing of corvids can be heard...\n\n[GetCountry('QII').GetName] has fallen, destroyed forevermore..."
 me_yan_15.a: "And yet we must continue to march south..."

 me_yan_16_title: "$yan_missions_task_16$"
 me_yan_16_desc: "It will please you, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], to discover that maritime trade is booming throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Our expansion of the port and commercial districts has done wonders to encourage local investment by the elites, and it is said that many of the largest Trading Guilds have sent merchants into the port cities in order to help facilitate economic growth."
 me_yan_16.a: "You are right - this bit of news makes me quite happy, indeed"

 me_yan_17_title: "$yan_missions_task_17$"
 me_yan_17_desc: "Although we have chastened the northern barbarians by teaching them a lesson that they shall not forget for generations to come, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] remains always mindful of the capriciousness of the gods, who bless a man one day with gifts beyond mortal comprehension before taking it all away.\n\nAfter personally inspecting the northern hinterlands, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] issued the order that a #E Northern Wall#! be constructed, one that would take advantage of the terrain - if any raiders from the steppes hope to come into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] unmolested, then they are in for the surprise of their lives."
 me_yan_17.a: "This wall will keep us safe from the hordes - you will see"

 me_yan_18_title: "$yan_missions_task_18$"
 me_yan_18_desc: "In a brilliant masterstroke of foreign policy, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has sent spies and informers throughout the lands to our east with full coin purses and the mission to spread dissension. It is the hope of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] that we will be able to play the contentious locals against each other, and as our messengers clandestinely fan the flames of the local feuds and disputes, the easterners will remain divided, thus becoming puppets for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to control."
 me_yan_18.a: "I am pulling your strings and you don't even know it...fools."

 me_yan_19_title: "$yan_missions_task_19$"
 me_yan_19_desc: "Frustrated by the reports of our military scouts, who have repeatedly claimed that the armies of [GetCountry('QIN').GetName] are exceptionally trained and on a permanent war footing, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided upon a murderous plot in order to cause chaos in the south; the assassination of [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetName].\n\nIt is only a matter of time before the Qin send their forces northward, and unless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] can frustrate their plans before they are set into motion, a ruinous war threatens to take away all that we have struggled to achieve.\n\nAs the King pondered this irrevocable course of action and what was to be done, an exiled nobleman named #E Ke Jing#!, who had lost everything to the Qin armies, arrived in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. Ke, desiring to see the Qin suffer as much as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] did, promised to set everything in motion, but asked for the funds to do so."
 me_yan_19.a: "Fifty talents should be enough to do the job..."
 me_yan_19.b: "Give Ke Jing everything he needs for success"
 
 me_yan_1900_title: "$yan_missions_task_19$"
 me_yan_1900_desc: "All of the preparations have been made, and Ke Jing will ride for the court of the Qin ruler in the morning. Ke will pretend to be fleeing from the Yan armies, who will be launching a 'suprise invasion', and will claim to have a map that reveals their troop movements. An exquisite dagger has been poisoned and placed inside of this map scroll, where it will be smuggled into the presence of the Qin and hopefully find its resting place in the King's heart.\n\nAs Ke is gathering the last of his things, he has sent a request to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], asking for some bodyguards to accompany him - he appears to be getting a little nervous and wants some experienced muscle at his back."
 me_yan_1900.a: "I believe we can spare a little of our expertise"
 me_yan_1900.b: "Everything that you ask for is yours!"
 
 me_yan_1901_title: "$yan_missions_task_19$"
 me_yan_1901_desc: "A message from Ke Jing has been smuggled to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], brought by plum wine merchants that snuck across the border without being questioned.\n\nKe Jing reports that all is well and that things are moving according to plan, and yet there has been a hiccup - the Qin are beginning to act suspicious, with some claiming that he is not a real nobleman at all, but a spy sent by one of the Qin's many enemies.\n\nIn order to throw the secret police off of his back, Ke is asking for an infusion of funds - he wants to spread some coin around [GetProvince('(int32)8313').GetName], perhaps hold a feast; he claims this will allow him to blend into high society better and perhaps get close to the Qin ruler."
 me_yan_1901.a: "By the gods, Ke asks for too much - send him what we can"
 me_yan_1901.b: "In for a penny, in for a pound...we can't back down at this point"
