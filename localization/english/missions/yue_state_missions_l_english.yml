 missions_yue_state_task_11_DESC: "The scheming #E Qi#! deflected King [GetCharacter('(int32)590').GetName]'s attack by promising that the #E Chu#! are easy prey, but our days of glory came to an end because of our folly to believe them; tell the Qi that they must submit to the Yue or else they will be utterly destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"

 missions_yue_state_task_13_DESC: "Merchants from all across the world sail from the waters of the Mare Luzon to the port district of our island of Yizhou.

In 306 BC, Yue was defeated again by Chu and lost Wu, shattering the state into a small part around Langya and a southern part. In 298 BC, all of it was conquered and the Yue dynasty fled to Minyue and Ouyue.
 me_yue_state_90_desc: "In 333 BC, King [GetCharacter('(int32)590').GetName] of Yue went north to attack Qi. He believed the Qi envoy named Tian and led his army to attack Chu, where he was unexpectedly ambushed, defeated and died. Since [GetCharacter('(int32)590').GetName] had no designated successor, the country of Yue fell apart and his eldest son, [GetCharacter('(int32)630').GetName], and second son, [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName], competed.\n\nTwo years ago the state of Chu used this weakness to conquer Wu, so that only a small strip of land around the city of Langya in the north and the southernmost territories around Kuaiji are left of the once great state of Yue."
 me_yue_state_90.a: "We need to immediately reclaim our lands."

 me_yue_tribes_90_title: "The Fall Of The State Of Yue"
 me_yue_tribes_90_desc: "In 333 BC, King [GetCharacter('(int32)590').GetName] of Yue went north to attack Qi. He believed the Qi envoy named Tian and led his army to attack Chu, where he was unexpectedly ambushed, defeated and died. Since [GetCharacter('(int32)590').GetName] had no designated successor, the country of Yue fell apart and his eldest son, [GetCharacter('(int32)630').GetName], and second son, [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName], competed.\n\nTwo years ago the state of Chu used this weakness to conquer Wu, so that only a small strip of land around the city of Langya in the north and the southernmost territories around Kuaiji are left of the once great state of Yue.\n\nSome say the dynasty's future no longer lies in the north but rather in the south among the Yue tribes."
