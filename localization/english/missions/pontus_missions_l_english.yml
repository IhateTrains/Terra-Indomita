A thriving city of enduring Greek heritage, it is a perfect embodiment of the Black Sea Greek identity. Rather than just constructing a summer residence in the city, our ruler is considering constructing a royal residence in the city of Sinope due to its strategic and cultural value.

 01_cde_pontus_missions_01_task_3_DESC: "If we wish to expand our influence across the Black Sea, we must first establish a strong fleet; to establish a strong fleet, we must have a designated naval base large enough to hold such a fleet. Thus, our advisors have agreed that the Greek city of Trapezous is an ideal location for this, since it already has a well-established port that is home to both fleets and merchants ships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@cde_city_thriving_icon!"

Amisos shall serve as a link for the economic and cultural connections between Pontus and the Greek cities along the northern and Black Sea shores. This would create an economically-unified sphere across the sea under our kingdom’s currency, setting the scene for the Greeks along the shores to accept our hegemony with open arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@north_african_army_path_4_icon!"

With our history of marriages to the Seleukid dynasty, our kings have since strived to establish Pontus as a legitimate and distinctly Hellenistic kingdom, from adopting the Hellenic title of basileus to designating Greek as the official language and script of the court. Thus, let us begin the policy of inviting individuals from foreign Hellenic states to serve in our court - of course, only from states that we trust. Such Hellenic influences will also make it easier for current and future Greek subjects to identify with our standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@cde_macedonian_court_icon!"

 01_cde_pontus_missions_01_task_51_DESC: "One of the defining traits of Greek civilization is the Greek polis, or city, which is home to many aspects of Hellenic culture that we wish to emulate in order to become a truly Hellenistic kingdom. In the Hellenistic kingdoms of the diadochi, subjects were sometimes offered privileges and greater opportunities for social mobility if they constructed Greek-style poleis and integrated into Hellenistic society. Thus, let us appeal to our Greek and non-Greek subjects by constructing great poleis across our own kingdom with a distinctly Greco-Pontic style.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@cde_greek_city_market_icon!"

While mercenaries generally fight only for coin and have no allegiance to one realm or another, perhaps we can build a sort of pseudo-friendship with these coin-hungry mercenaries by showing them that we shall treat them well in times of war. Thus, let us continue to build strong ties with the Greek mercenaries along the sea so we may build a reputation as a client that treats its mercenaries with dignity and respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_states_path_7_icon!"

 cde_me_pon_01.1.desc: "Over a century ago, our founder Mithridates Ktistes established a small kingdom in Paphlagonia that eventually grew into the great kingdom of Pontus that reigns today. Our dynasty is descended from Persian nobility, and we can even trace our lineage back to the families of the great Achaemenid kings Cyrus and Darius of Persia. To create a pan-Pontic state that can resist the influence of both Rome and the Hellenistic kingdoms, let us first begin staking claim to our ancestral lands in Colchis and Paphlagonia, realms once held by our noble forefathers during the Achaemenid era."
 cde_me_pon_01.1.a: "Let us build a kingdom worthy of our ancestral legacy!"

 cde_me_pon_01.3.t: "New Royal Residence in Sinope"
 cde_me_pon_01.3.desc: "The monarchy's summer residence in the coastal city of Sinope has been expanded by#Y [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]#!, which in turn has elevated the importance and status of the city in our kingdom. Though Sinope was a recent acquisition of Mithridates V, its strategic position along the coast as well as its enduring prosperity and Hellenic legacy make it a prime candidate for a new capital. Thus, as we plan our expansion across the Black Sea, perhaps a coastal capital in Sinope would serve us better, which would involve permanently moving the royal family to Sinope."
 cde_me_pon_01.3.a: "Move the capital to Sinope."
 cde_me_pon_01.3.b: "Just a summer palace there is enough."
 cde_me_pon_01.4.t: "Expanded Shipyard in Trapezous"
 cde_me_pon_01.4.desc: "We have expanded the already-bustling port city of Trapezous into a central naval base for the Pontic fleet. To accomodate this expansion, the naval shipyard has been greatly expanded, allowing us to house and construct larger numbers of ships than before."

By continuing to unite all of the Black Sea under Pontic currency, we shall create a united Pontic economic sphere, with individuals all united under a Helleno-Pontic identity."

 cde_me_pon_01.22.desc: "Now that we have established a naval base in Trapezous, we now have the means to protect the Greeks across the sea. The Greeks in Taurica have been all but defeated by the Royal Scythians, with Chersonesus as well as the cities of the Bosporan Kingdom being the only former Greek colonies that have not fallen to Scythian rule. Thus, let us stake claims to Taurica so we may cross the seas as sincere defenders of Greek autonomy!"

 cde_me_pon_01.24.desc: "With the city of Chersonesos secured under Pontic influence, it is time that we look elsewhere for expanding our influence across the Black Sea coast. Our Chersonese friends tell us of the rich emporia of Olbia and Tyras, once influential Greek cities that have now fallen under the influence of the barbarian tribes of the Scythians and Sarmatians to the north. Thus, as protectors of the Euxine Greeks, let us liberate those cities as well."

 cde_me_pon_01.25.desc: "We have liberated the trade cities of Olbia and Tyras from their barbarian overlords, driving back the Scythians and Sarmatians so they may no longer raid the cities and strike fear into the hearts of the vulnerable Greeks along the coast."

 cde_me_pon_01.26.desc: "We have seized the prestigious Scythian city of Neapolis. Home to both Scythian and Greek peoples, the Scythians have admittedly developed Neapolis into a bustling center of Taurica, with Greek traders, architects and artisans contributing to the culture and wealth of the city. Thus, we have invested our own funds to expand the city of Neapolis as a strategic, economic and cultural center of Pontus in Taurica."

This roots out those who are disatisfied with our rule, leaving only loyal Scythians, or at least those that are indifferent, as subjects of our kingdom. Thus, let us crush these Scythian rebels and show all of the tribes that we are not to be defied!"
