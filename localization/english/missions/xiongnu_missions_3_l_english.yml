 xiongnu_missions_3:0 "Xiongnu of China"
 xiongnu_missions_3_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Great Xiongnu Empire, in historical terms, did not subjugate China to rule it. Indeed, the successors of Modun were content with the Heqin marriage-alliance system whereby the Chinese would annually send women, silk, rice, wine, exotic goods, gold and silver to the Xiongnu in exchange for only lightly pillaging their borderlands. But what if the Chanyu's were not content with just plunder, as the their future succesors, like Kublai Khan of the Mongols were? What would happen if they would directly rule all of China and more? "
 xiongnu_missions_3_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when China is fully under the control of the Xiongnu Empire."
 xiongnu_missions_3_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "We will be the masters of all China!"

 #Missions

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_1:0 "Zhaoan Subjects"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_1_DESC:0 "The Zhao have long had a policy of mimicking our fighting and clothing style in an attempt to fend off our aggression, in a similar manner to the former Yan state. We must begin our invasion here, against one of our most capable foes, to neuter any chance at our tactical advantages in cavalry being negated by Chinese strategists."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_2:0 "Destroy Zhao"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_2_DESC:0 "We cannot be content with just neutering Zhao - their state must cease to exist as a political entity if we are to gain dominion over the riches of the Yellow River."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_3:0 "Incorporate the Han"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_3_DESC:0 "The second of the three Jins - the Han state - has long been a weakling amongst the Warring States. They are small and vulernable, and have yet to see the hooves of the hundred nations of the Xiongnu outside of their cities. Let us demonstrate our might against the Han and plunder their rich cities before they are taken by the other powers."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_4:0 "Crush Chu"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_4_DESC:0 "Chu has long been in decline despite holding vast terriroties stretching beyond the fertile plains, into the deep tropical jungles of the south. We should pounce on Chu and gobble up their vast territory lest the Qin or Qi states beat us to it."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_5:0 "Chew Chu"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_5_DESC:0 "It is time to finally end the existence of the depleted Chu state - they are fortunate to now live under the yolk of our great Chanyu, who will better manage their lands."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_6:0 "Mouth of the Yellow River"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_6_DESC:0 "The mouth of the Yellow River is both replete with wealthy cities and is of crucial military importance to deny our enemies of naval ports with which they can strike us on the coast indiscriminately. In particular, the region of Linzi is greatly desired by the Great Chanyu, as it rumoured to possess wealth beyond measure as well as a dense population of potential slaves. Let our horses ride forth to dominate the mouth of that great river!"

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_7:0 "Check Qi"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_7_DESC:0 "The Qi have been one of the most powerful states of the Middle Kingdom for centuries now. Their tacticians have proven capable, their artisans more brilliant than all the world, and their capital of Linzi is unparalled in splendor, knowledge and wealth. All the things our Great Chanyu desires for himself..."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_8:0 "Final Song"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_8_DESC:0 "The land of Confucius harbors several wealthy cities and is a bastion of modern philosphical thought. Our Chanyu is curious about these newfound philosphies, their origins and the people from whom they derive. Unfortunately for the leaders of Song, this means their lands will now belong to the Xiongnu."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_9:0 "Famed Wu"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_9_DESC:0 "From recently acquired Chinese texts, told by the Chinese historians now employed by our court, the old territory of Wu was a powerful state defeated last century, and was brought down by the most beautiful woman to have ever lived, Xi Shi. Her beauty seduced the king of Wu, much as this tale has seduced our Chanyu. We must ride out to the lands of the Wu and investigate the local legends to please the Chanyu; resistance to this quest will not be tolerated. "

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_10:0 "Oh Yueh"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_10_DESC:0 "The hundred Yue tribes, long the bane of Chinese civilization, are now our problem inherited from our conquests. The tropical diseases, strange animals, and painted bodies of jungle warriors all haunt our cavalry, while the Chinese infantry also cower in fear. We must shatter the notion of mystique surrounding these barbarians and crush them into dirt."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_11:0 "Consolidate North-Western China"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_11_DESC:0 "The Qin are our final great foe of China, and must be boxed in. Controlling the lands surrounding their heartland will ensure we have no rivals in the Yellow River and give us a a launching pad from which to strike their capital."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_12:0 "Extinguish Qin"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_12_DESC:0 "The end of the Warring States period draws near - with the sound of hooves trampling through the Qin capital of Xianyang and tearing down the palaces of Chang'an. The Chanyu will have the entire Chinese nation bowing before his valiant steed after the Qin have been destroyed."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_13:0 "Storm the Sichuan Basin"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_13_DESC:0 "The Sichuan Basin is replete with exotic animals, tea and other goods the Chanyu greatly covets. The Basin must belong to the Great Chanyu, if not peacefully, then by force."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_14:0 "Three Gorges"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_14_DESC:0 "The mountainous upper reaches of the Yangtze are a difficult country. Ba, Shu, Rong and various other tribal entities have long given the Chinese trouble from these reaches, and even after their conquest by the likes of Qin and Chu, continued to be a bastion of rebellion. However, the areas are strategically significant - the rivers are a highway from which groups can conduct trade and raids throughout the entirety of the Yangtze, and are crucial to assert total dominance over the Sichuan Basin. Let us crush any remaining opposition in these areas and secure our position in the Upper Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, permanently."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_15:0 "Southern Hills"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_15_DESC:0 "The deep reaches of the southern forests and hills have given us as much trouble as they gave the Chu before us - various tribal groups continually harass our patrols, disease runs rampant, and the terrain is difficult for our horsemen. However the lands present great opporunity... great tusked beasts roam the jungles, other exotic animals can be found in these biomes, and silk, rice and metals can be found in great quantities. The Chanyu greatly desires control of these southern lands, so we must clear any tribal opposition and take full control."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_16:0 "Ferghana Valley"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_16_DESC:0 "The Ferghana Valley, inhabited by a myriad of Greek, Sogdian, Saka and other peoples, are rumoured to possess horses of the finest quality. And indeed this appears to be case according to our scouts and tradesmen; the 'Heavenly Horses' are among the finest steeds known in the world. It is inexcusable for the greatest of horsemen, the Xiognnu, to not have this breed of horse in our stables. We must strike forth and claim these lands in the name of the Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_17:0 "The Heaven's Horses"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_17_DESC:0 "The Heavenly Horses of the Ferghana Basin have been a primary target of our western campaigns, as maintaining the best quality horses is of the utmost strategic value for the Empire. Let us expand the breeding and export of these animals for the sake of the Great Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_18:0 "Bonfire of Zhou"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_18_DESC:0 "The ancient seat of the Middle Kingdom at Chengzhou will be the greatest prize of the Xiongnu. For centuries the legitimacy of the Zhou kings lay at the palace of this fabled city, accumulating wealth beyond measure and housing the holy objects of their people. By conquering and sacking this city, our Great Chanyu will eliminate the political system of the Chinese, demoralize the remaining Warring States, claim the vast treaures of the Zhou for our tribesmen and demonstrate our dominance over all of China."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_19:0 "Enslave Chinese"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_19_DESC:0 "The newly conquered Chinese population must be put in their place. The days of their cultural and political dominance are now over, and their peoples will now serve as nothing man than slaves to the Great Chanyu. Let us enshrine their 'rights' in our laws, and create a permanent slave class out of the once mighty Middle Kingdom."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_20:0 "Looking for Freedom"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_20_DESC:0 "We shall continue the path forged by our forefathers like Touman and Modun - we shun the trappings of settled civilization and make our living subjugating and pillaging the city-dwellers of the world. We will forever seek glory on the back of our horse and not fall prey to the complacency of settled life like our Huaxia slaves."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_21:0 "The Great City of Ji"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_21_DESC:0 "The city of Ji lay in the perfect position between our homelands in the vast steppe north of the Gobi, and the great Chinese civilization now mostly controlled by our empire. We shall consecrate a southern capital at this great city to unite steppe civilization with Chinese urbanism."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_22:0 "Sinicization"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_22_DESC:0 "The Xiongnu ethnic peoples have become a small minority, not just among our steppe tribal folk, but now especially among the throngs of the Chinese we have subjugated. If we have any hope of maintaining control of China, we must integrate their peoples, accept Chinese ways and adopt more of their cultural practices."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_23:0 "Xiongnu Dynasty"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_23_DESC:0 "Our conquest over a people so vastly more numerous than our own, with a sophisticated culture millenia old, has led to a slow progress of Sinicization of our peoples. And indeed, the people of the Middle Kingdom are slowly becoming used to having foreign overlords, but hesitation still remains among their people, especially the educated elites. Should we, Great Chanyu, fully embrace the title of #E Son of Heaven#! to fully legitimize our rule of China, and fully adopt their well-established beauracratic systems to better rule over our vast, multi-ethnic empire?"

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_24:0 "Side Corridor"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_24_DESC:0 "While the #E Hexi corridor#! in the north is the primary route of travel from #E China#! to the #E Tarim Basin#!, there is another, more difficult passage to the south running from the southern edge of #E Tocharian#! lands eastward through northern #E Tibet #!. This corridor is inhabited by #E Rong#! tribal peoples known as the #E Nuomuhong#!, and presents a strategic liability for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] should our enemies come to use it for military or economic gain. Let us secure this passage and ensure we control all routes leading out of #E China#!."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_25:0 "Wei's Demise"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_25_DESC:0 "The final of the three Jins, Wei, sits at the heart of the Yellow River. We must strike forth to attain the great plunder of Daliang and rip the heart out of the Middle Kingdom."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_26:0 "Mouths of Great Rivers"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_26_DESC:0 "The mouths of the other two great rivers of China - the Huai and Yangtze - must be put under the sword if we ever hope to stop the flow of the aid coming to Chinese rebels from this coastline and up the rivers."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_27:0 "Work the Silk Farms"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_27_DESC:0 "The secret of silk manufacture is now in our hands as the masters of all China. Let us exploit this knowledge and ramp up production of silk to enrich the imperial coffers."

 xiongnu_missions_3_task_28:0 "Control the Silk Road"
 xiongnu_missions_3_task_28_DESC:0 "Control over China and the Silk Road will lead to one thousand years of prosperity for our nation. Merchants from across the world will seek our metropoli for the never-ending wealth that our country generates, for the hope of bringing just a piece back to their home."

Their attempts to adopt the dress and tactics of the Hu barbarians only delayed the inevitable. While they were able to hold off hordes of Di and Donghu, as well as become a major player in the Warring States conflicts, they have finally succumbed to the might of the Xiongnu. As the Zhao people get accustomed to their new masters, we shall decide what becomes of their great capital, Handan... "

Their incompetent generals dared to challenge the Chanyu in the open field, with their infantry being buried under a mountain of thundering hooves. All that is left is to determine in what manner we shall rule our new Han subjects, and how much we will take from the great city of Zheng."

A number of populous cities are now at the mercy of our tribesmen, along with their immense wealth. In particular, the city of Wan holds stragetic value, being at the crossroads between Qin, Chu and the lands of the Zhou Emperor. What shall become of this city?"
 me_xiongnu_3_4.a:0 "It will be a bastion for our hordes."

The jungles and diseases of these more humid lands took a heavy toll on our horsemen, but the valuable city of Chaisang, an important Yangtze port, was worth the sacrifice, for the treasures within the city are among the greatest yet seen. The lives of our kin were not lost in vain, for the Xiongnu are now more powerful than ever. What shall become of this illustrious city on the Yangtze?"

Additionally, the lands are replete with vast farms suitable for the production of grain, rice and a number of other foodstuffs to feed our growing legion. The great port of Fuyang also has potential to serve as naval bastion for empire, if we so desire..."
 me_xiongnu_3_6.a:0 "Fuyang will serve as our new northern port."

The great city of Linzi, perhaps the most wonderous city in the known world, was a sight to behold for our Great Chanyu, in particular the Jixia Academy and the Royal Palace. The Chanyu simultaneously held two visions before him for this bastion of civilization - one of continued splendor under his rule, and one of complete destruction celebrated by the many clans of the Xiongnu. Which vision shall we pursue?"
 me_xiongnu_3_7.a:0 "Linzi will be the new crown jewel in our growing empire."

The great walled cities of Song imparted some attrition to our forces, but with our vast host and Chinese siege engineers, we were able to easily overcome their numerous forts. The cities of Song hold a number of cultural artifacts, hundreds of gold treasures, and tens of thousands of new Chinese subjects. What shall become of the land of Confucius, and their great, ancient city of Suiyang?"

This only makes sense, as the vast majority of the population of our nation is here, and we have increasingly adopted many of their customs, taken to their military strategies, adopted their technologies and become used to their luxuries. These days, the Chanyu even employs more Chinese advisors, philosphers, engineers and strategists than his native Xiongnu tribesmen. Given all of this, we should refashion the old Yan capital of Ji in the north as the new capital of our vast kingdom."

We cannot let the naysayer tribal elites of the confederation deter our ambition.

The men harped on the adoption of Chinese religious rites and rituals by the Chanyu, asking if the Chanyu cared more for speaking to mystical bronze cauldrons than he did the impoverished tribespeople at the edges of his domain. The more conservative tribal factions came away from the meeting thinking of the Chanyu more as the Son of Heaven after the affair."

A group of our most reliable and politically powerful kinsmen in Longcheng sent word that if they too were not rewarded for their loyalty as the disgruntled. The price asked by the cohort was staggering and would have been laughable had the Chanyu not been so insulted. The open bribery scheme, cloaked politically by the idea of maintaining Xiongnu traditional values, sent the Chanyu into a furious rage, before he calmed himself to discuss the best option going forward. We could either pay the price by going bankrupt to maintain the loyalties, or finally end this open bribery scheme, risking further instability."

Gone are the days of rugged life on the open steppe, as tribesmen regularly stay in the capital and enjot the trappings of civilization before going back to their tribal holdings with the wealth and luxury of civilization to disperse to their people.  It was not without its price, as many of the conservative tribal elites resisted our attempts to modernize, only being persuaded by promises of gold and glory.
