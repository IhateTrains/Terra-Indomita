 lu_missions: "All Zhou Rituals Are In Lu"
 lu_missions_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, the [GetCountry('LUU').GetName)] state was established in [GetProvince('(int32)8533').GetName] and given to Bo Qin by the Duke of Zhou. For many generations we have ruled over these lands, but the Lu are not as strong as they once were.\n\nEver since the great #! Battle of Changshao#! many years ago, our strength has been waning in the shadow of the states of [GetCountry('QIIU').GetName)] and [GetCountry('CHU').GetName)]. For many years, the #E Three Huan#!, a group of three powerful families, held our great state of Lu in a stranglehold, and it wasn't until the time of Confucius many generations ago that the authority of the Dukes of Lu was once again restored.\n\nToday, times are as uncertain as ever; all of the kings of the #E Middle Kingdom#! are at each other's throats, and the respect afforded to the #E Zhou Emperor#! is fading more with each day. The ever-expanding borders of the Qi and Chu has put the stability of our once great state in peril; only time will tell what history has in store for the legendary Dukes of Lu."
 lu_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when Lu has defeated its rival states of the Middle Kingdom."

 lu_missions_task_1_DESC: "It is clear that the time for war is quickly approaching, but the only question that remains is with whom and when. Many in our nation suggest that we prepare ourselves immediately for the ensuing struggle that seems to be all but inevitable at this point... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil10!"

 # Lu was a famous country of etiquette. The close relationship between the Lu State and the Zhou rites resulted in the formation of a simple folk custom of humility and courtesy in the Lu State. At the same time, it also greatly affected the development of the Lu State's national power. When the rites and music in the Spring and Autumn Period collapsed, people at that time still said that Lu still upheld the rites of Zhou. 
 lu_missions_task_2: "Lu Etiquette"
 lu_missions_task_2_DESC: "Although many of the surrounding [GetCountry('ZHO').GetName)] dynasties have abandoned the countless formal rites and rituals of the once great Dynasty, the Dukes of [GetCountry('LUU').GetName)] have never once wavered in their undying loyalty to the esteemed traditions of the past.\n\n Proper etiquette has always been a commonality among all competent Lu statesmen. Even though, over time, the many states around us have left the old ways behind them, the never-ending tides of time have yet to change the ways of Lu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil8!"

A direct confrontation with the larger states of [GetCountry('QII').GetName)] or [GetCountry('CHU').GetName)] at this point could lead to our demise. Seizing the lands of Song would strengthen our position and perhaps even deter any would-be invaders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil3!"
