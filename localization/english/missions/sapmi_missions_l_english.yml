 #Events
 me_sapmi_1_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_1$"
 me_sapmi_1_desc: "We must dominate the sea! It is our lifeblood. From it merchants come, food can be imported, furs can be exported. It is only natural that a people like us produce a navy fitting for our needs. This will also allow us to further our influence, if we so wish to do so, across the sea."
 me_sapmi_1.a: "We will seize the seas!"

 me_sapmi_2_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_2$"

 me_sapmi_3_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_3$"
 me_sapmi_3_desc: "From the river #E Velho#! and #E Musta#! to the river #E Vain#! our ships sailed. Our understanding of the terrain and surveying of the land is adequate enough as it is attractive.

 me_sapmi_3.a: "The lands of the Fenns will be ours!"
 
 me_sapmi_300_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_3$"
 me_sapmi_300_desc: "In order to explore the #E Baltic Sea#!, we must pay the experienced leadership from our own navy. The captain of the crew will need to be paid, but the allure of the sea and any mysteries it may hold is certainly well worth the gold."

 me_sapmi_301_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_3$"

 me_sapmi_4_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_4$"

 me_sapmi_5_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_5$"

 me_sapmi_5.a: "The Baltic is mare nostrum."

 me_sapmi_6_title: "$sapmi_missions_task_6$"
