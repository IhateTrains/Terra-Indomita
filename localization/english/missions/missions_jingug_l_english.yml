 missions_jingug: "The Lord of Jin"
 missions_jingug_DESCRIPTION: "The peninsula that comprises the region of #E Jin#! is home to Kings and Chieftains that challenge each other for control of the land, and it has been this way for as long as any can remember. Although many desire to declare themselves to be the true #E Lord of Jin#!, up until this moment, no one has been able to bring the various tribes and kingdoms under a centralized authority, and many claim that this feat shall never be accomplished.\n\nAnd yet the omens taken within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] offer up a different narrative; there shall arise a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] that will unite the polities under a single banner and establish a kingdom whose name shall echo throughout eternity! And not only will the peninsula be ours, but the islands to the east we claim as our own - prepare the fleets and levies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for the days of glory to come!"
 missions_jingug_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has defeated the threats in the north, consolidated our #E Tributaries#! in the south, and have conquered an overseas empire that will send tributes to our capital of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."

 missions_jingug_task_1_DESC: "It has been decided within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that our northern tributaries must be drawn closer together with the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. We must organize a conference where we inform our client states about their new responsibilities and the expectations that we have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil2!"

 missions_jingug_task_2: "Setting Sail"
 missions_jingug_task_2_DESC: "For a long time, [GetCountry('DMN').GetName] has resisted the inevitable, but the time has come to put an end to their delusions of independence from the mainland. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has ordered that a navy be constructed with the express purpose of bringing the islanders to heel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil1!"

 missions_jingug_task_3: "Bronzecraft"
 missions_jingug_task_3_DESC: "Our armorers and weaponsmiths have become well-acquainted with working with bronze, which can be found in various regions of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], but there is more that we could do to increase production. Building a #T Blacksmith#! workshop directly in a province that has base metals @base_metals! would facilitate these efforts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil6!"

 missions_jingug_task_4: "Conquest of Joseon"
 missions_jingug_task_4_DESC: "We can no longer afford to ignore the threat to our way of life that [GetCountry('JSN').GetName] poses.

 missions_jingug_task_5: "Convert the Kodo"
 missions_jingug_task_5_DESC: "Although the Kodo faith has spread like wildfire through our southern provinces, we must ensure that the proper Muisic ways of worship are being observed throughout our entire realm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil11!"

 missions_jingug_task_6: "Island Tamna"
 missions_jingug_task_6_DESC: "Once we secure the island of [GetCountry('DMN').GetName] for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we will be able to cast our gaze to the east, where other islands that are ripe for conquest shall fall to our forces. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil4!"

 missions_jingug_task_7: "Ritual Bronze Daggers"
 missions_jingug_task_7_DESC: "Recently, our metalworkers have been crafting long, slender knives that are referred to as #E Sehyungdonggeom#! in our language. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil3!"

 missions_jingug_task_8_DESC: "The fame and glory of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will be immortalized if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] is able to drive the barbarians out of northern #E Jin#! - the only power on our peninsula must be [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil1!"

 missions_jingug_task_9: "Tribal Center of Jinhan"
 missions_jingug_task_9_DESC: "The province of #E Jinhan#! has been home to a distinct culture of lesser tribal kingdoms that have long evaded direct control in our confederacy. Their lands lay inland in the rugged terrain between the eastern and our homeland, with rogue tribal chiefs periodically raiding trade caravans bringing goods from eastern ports to our capital. We must directly control these lands to ensure the safety of our caravans and civilize our tribal kinsmen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil3!"

 missions_jingug_task_11: "Northern Wall"
 missions_jingug_task_11_DESC: "If we are able to successfully build worthy fortifications in our north, then we shall be able to protect everything that we have fought and died for - the sacrifices of our ancestors should not be in vain!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil14!"

 missions_jingug_task_12: "Capitals of Jingug"
 missions_jingug_task_12_DESC: "Now that we are the undisputed masters of our realm, it has been proposed that we choose a new capital - are we truly happy with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]?

 missions_jingug_task_14: "Across the Sea"
 missions_jingug_task_14_DESC: "One by one, the small chiefdoms of #E Wa#! are collapsing before the march on our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] forces. If the gods continue to bless our armies with victory, then perhaps we shall take all of the eastern islands for ourselves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil11!"

 missions_jingug_task_15: "Big in Japan"
 missions_jingug_task_15_DESC: "The news of our eternal victory over the armies of #E Wa#! has reached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], where a week-long celebration has been ordered by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. The island of Wa is ours!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

 #Events 
 me_jingug_1_title: "$missions_jingug_task_1$"
 me_jingug_1_desc: "On a sunny day without a cloud in the sky, a curious gathering assembled within the citadel of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and from the first moment the barbarian Chieftains from the north passed through the fortress gates, the peasants stopped their work and watched the proud retinues, dressed in full tribal regalia, pass by on their horses. It was truly a sight to behold, and one that would not be seen by the locals for a long time.\n\nThe occasion was a momentous one for the region; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that our northern tributaries must become full #E feudatories#! - our relationship with our friends has been a pleasant one, and it would increase security and prosperity for all involved if they acquiesced to our demands. Thankfully for them, they have all agreed to what [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has suggested.\n\nThe only one displeased by this development is [GetCountry('JSN').GetRuler.GetName] of [GetCountry('JSN').GetName], who has foolishly entertained his own designs for the region and is frustrated by the deft political maneuvering of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]."
 me_jingug_1.a: "This day shall be celebrated forevermore by our sons and daughters"
 
 me_jingug_100_title: "$missions_jingug_task_1$"
 me_jingug_100_desc: "Now that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has consulted with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] advisors, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has made the decision to invite some of our neighboring chieftains to our capital. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is prepared to make the case that the growing strength of [GetCountry('JSN').GetName] can no longer be ignored by our tributaries, and that it would be in everyone's best interests if they submitted entirely to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nAnd yet nothing is set in stone; will our tributaries accept these terms? We shall know within a few weeks."
 me_jingug_100.a: "I cannot wait for the diplomats to arrive at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]"

 me_jingug_2_title: "$missions_jingug_task_2$"
 me_jingug_2_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have finally built a fleet worthy of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective], just as you have ordered, but that is not all - we have simultaneously sent an embassy to [GetCountry('DMN').GetName] informing them that we have claimed their island for ourselves."
 me_jingug_2.a: "Our sailors and soldiers are ready for whatever may come"

 me_jingug_3_title: "$missions_jingug_task_3$"
 me_jingug_3_desc: "We are pleased to report that the #E Blacksmith#! building that we have recently constructed has quickly become a valuable resource for teaching others about the craft of working with base metals @base_metals!.\n\nOnce an aspiring blacksmith has spent a few weeks studying with the great masters out in the wilderness, they return to their local villages and settlements and share what they have learned with their kinsmen. Now, a great deal of our tribesmen are skilled metalworkers and are able to craft their own weapons and armor - a boon to the levies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_jingug_3.a: "This is a most auspicious beginning, indeed"

 me_jingug_4_title: "$missions_jingug_task_4$"
 me_jingug_4_desc: "Truth be told, there were some voices within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that feared a potential conflict with [GetCountry('JSN').GetName], for they controlled a vast territory and were no strangers to warfare. Their horse archers are especially deadly, with many mercenaries from the steppes riding alongside their levies - certainly no easy target.\n\nBut [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was not convinced of the threat and boldly announced that we would be invading the homelands of our enemies, promising that victory would be ours and that greater glories would be found after we demolished the [GetCountry('JSN').GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] Dynasty.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, everything that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] vowed would come to pass."
 me_jingug_4.a: "In one fell stroke, we have secured vast swathes of territory"

 me_jingug_5_title: "$missions_jingug_task_5$"
 me_jingug_5_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], you will be pleased to learn that the true faith, #E Muisic#!, has conquered the false teachings and superstitions of the barbaric #E Kodo#! teachings that were beginning to take root in the south. Although many of the elites living in the southern fortresses and redoubts had not completely abandoned our Muisic ways, the locals were beginning to ignore the dragons and were offering incense and libations to rustic deities and demons.\n\nBut, thanks to the pressures applied by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], the fires of the Kodo have been stamped underfoot and proper ritual has been restored. It is said that there was a local priest who was instrumental in leading these conversion efforts, and as a way of thanking the pious man, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has extended an invitation for the monk to visit the court at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."
 me_jingug_5.a: "I wanted to thank you for all that you have done for me"

 me_jingug_6_title: "$missions_jingug_task_6$"
 me_jingug_6_desc: "Now that we have conquered the island of [GetCountry('DMN').GetName], it has been suggested to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that we press eastward, for there are valuable islands that are relatively undefended - the barbarian tribal hordes will pose no threat to our disciplined armies.\n\nIt appears that we shall be using the island of Tamna as a staging point for further invasions."
 me_jingug_6.a: "One by one, the islands shall fall to our forces!"

 me_jingug_7_title: "$missions_jingug_task_7$"
 me_jingug_7_desc: "As our metalworkers and master craftsmen began to experiment within their workshops, they began to abandon the wider, lute-shaped knife designs that they had once favored for a long, slender shape. This new type of dagger, named #E 'Sehyungdonggeom'#!, quickly became popular amongst the elites, and before long, this new style of construction replaced the older methods entirely.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who always has [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] finger on the pulse of what's going on within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], asked that a set of these blades be sent to the capital, in order for the nobles of the nation to marvel at the exceptional handiwork of our workers."
 me_jingug_7.a: "What incredibly slender daggers...a work of art!"

 me_jingug_8_title: "$missions_jingug_task_8$"
 me_jingug_8_desc: "News of our victories against the Northern Jin have arrived in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and this auspicious state of affairs has resulted in all of the rice wine within the capital being consumed. The barbarians have been driven out of their mountain redoubts, and a period of peace is upon the land.\n\nThe streets are filled with rambunctious crowds, drunkenly swaying and singing, and everyone is toasting the continued health of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the chief architect of these unequalled accomplishments."
 me_jingug_8.a: "Another drink! I raise this bowl of wine for you, o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]...hic..."

 me_jingug_9_title: "$missions_jingug_task_9$"
 me_jingug_9_desc: "In order to remind our former tributaties of their new obligations and duties to the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], it has been decreed that a new city shall be constructed in the region. It is the hope of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that this new municipality draws the locals of the region together, anchoring their shared prosperity with our own."
 me_jingug_9.a: "This will only be a good thing for the region, mark my words"

 me_jingug_10_title: "$missions_jingug_task_10$"
 me_jingug_10_desc: "Our spies on the islands have been talking to local collaborators, who have informed our men that the island of #E Wa#! is in a terribly disorganized state, ruled by many squabbling lords and kings that are ripe for conquering ourselves. Once [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] heard this news, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] immediately ordered that our forces prepare for further invasions."
 me_jingug_10.a: "We must take advantage of their fractured state"

 me_jingug_11_title: "$missions_jingug_task_11$"
 me_jingug_11_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the fortifications that you have ordered be built throughout our north are finally completed, and the local military engineers promise that no barbarian horde shall be able to bypass the strong walls that they have built.\n\nThanks to these efforts, our provincial administrators have revealed that, due to a surplus of supplies, we have some investments that we could make; another boon for the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_jingug_11.a: "I shall take their word...or else I will have their heads"

 me_jingug_12_title: "$missions_jingug_task_12$"
 me_jingug_12_desc: "Now that the dust has settled a bit and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has a moment to focus upon tasks that do not involve commanding our levies, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has been toying with the idea of relocating our capital to someplace new within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nAnd yet there are multiple locations that are worthy, and the omens speak favorably, claiming that any place that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] chooses will be blessed throughout the ages. Where shall we send the architects?"
 me_jingug_12.a: "We shall relocate to the Mahan provinces"
 me_jingug_12.b: "The Byeonhan provinces would make a splendid location"
 me_jingug_12.c: "The Lelang region attracts me"

 me_jingug_13_title: "$missions_jingug_task_13$"
 me_jingug_13_desc: "Once the triumphant armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] were able to dislodge the barbarians from the eastern coasts of #E Jin#!, many of our tributaries submitted to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], asking to become feudatories and begging [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to welcome them into the confederacy that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] was carving out across the peninsula.\n\nSlowly but surely, the Jingug are dominating the region..."
 me_jingug_13.a: "The gods have decreed this moment, and I would have it no other way"

 me_jingug_14_title: "$missions_jingug_task_14$"
 me_jingug_14_desc: "As word reaches [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] of the stunning string of successes that our armies have secured in the East, even [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] appears surprised to hear this news. When asked by an advisor what the next moves should be, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] cleared [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] throat and addressed the court.\n\n'I have heard that the inhabitants of #E Wa#! were noble warriors, worthy of respect and admiration, but it appears that this reputation has been built upon a foundation of lies. They are weak, and if we continue to gently squeeze them, then they shall burst within our hands like a rotten plum.'"
 me_jingug_14.a: "We must continue to move against Wa - the gods grant us everything"

 me_jingug_15_title: "$missions_jingug_task_15$"
 me_jingug_15_desc: "Although the locals are resisting our efforts to convert and assimilate them, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] cannot help but laugh at the foolish efforts of the people of #E Wa#! to resist the inevitable.\n\nThe local governors are pushing forward with these civilizing efforts, although the peasants of Wa are certainly struggling to maintain their own identities. We have heard a few scattered reports of our soldiers being attacked on the roads by groups of bandits, and there has even been attempts by local troublemakers to foment rebellion, although they have not managed anything thus far.\n\nDespite the severity of these reports, which warns of potential danger on the island in the future, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is amused by their feeble efforts to liberate themselves."
 me_jingug_15.a: "If only they had fought like this when we first arrived!"
 
 me_jingug_16_title: "$missions_jingug_task_16$"
 me_jingug_16_desc: "From the highest point in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], the blast of the trumpet fills the air and the sound of drums being pounded overwhelms all senses. A grand celebration is being held within the capital, for today, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] feels confident enough in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] achievements to proclaim the beginning of a new age, one in which the Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] rules over a united peninsula and overseas holdings - the true Lord of the Land and Sea."
 me_jingug_16.a: "From this day forth, the Era of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] begins!"
