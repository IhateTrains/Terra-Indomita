 missions_jingug_task_1_DESC: "It has been decided within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that our northern tributaries must be drawn closer together with the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. We must organize a conference where we inform our client states about their new responsibilities and the expectations that we have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil2!"

 missions_jingug_task_2: "Setting Sail"
 missions_jingug_task_2_DESC: "For a long time, [GetCountry('DMN').GetName] has resisted the inevitable, but the time has come to put an end to their delusions of independence from the mainland. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has ordered that a navy be constructed with the express purpose of bringing the islanders to heel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil1!"

 #Events 
 me_jingug_1_title: "$missions_jingug_task_1$"
 me_jingug_1_desc: "On a sunny day without a cloud in the sky, a curious gathering assembled within the citadel of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and from the first moment the barbarian Chieftains from the north passed through the fortress gates, the peasants stopped their work and watched the proud retinues, dressed in full tribal regalia, pass by on their horses. It was truly a sight to behold, and one that would not be seen by the locals for a long time.\n\nThe occasion was a momentous one for the region; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that our northern tributaries must become full #E feudatories#! - our relationship with our friends has been a pleasant one, and it would increase security and prosperity for all involved if they acquiesced to our demands. Thankfully for them, they have all agreed to what [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has suggested.\n\nThe only one displeased by this development is [GetCountry('JSN').GetRuler.GetName] of [GetCountry('JSN').GetName], who has foolishly entertained his own designs for the region and is frustrated by the deft political maneuvering of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]."

 me_jingug_2_title: "$missions_jingug_task_2$"
 me_jingug_2_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we have finally built a fleet worthy of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective], just as you have ordered, but that is not all - we have simultaneously sent an embassy to [GetCountry('DMN').GetName] informing them that we have claimed their island for ourselves."
 me_jingug_2.a: "Our sailors and soldiers are ready for whatever may come"

 me_jingug_3_title: "$missions_jingug_task_3$"
 me_jingug_3_desc: "We are pleased to report that the #E Blacksmith#! building that we have recently constructed has quickly become a valuable resource for teaching others about the craft of working with base metals @base_metals!.\n\nOnce an aspiring blacksmith has spent a few weeks studying with the great masters out in the wilderness, they return to their local villages and settlements and share what they have learned with their kinsmen. Now, a great deal of our tribesmen are skilled metalworkers and are able to craft their own weapons and armor - a boon to the levies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 me_jingug_3.a: "This is a most auspicious beginning, indeed"

 me_jingug_4_title: "$missions_jingug_task_4$"
 me_jingug_4_desc: "Truth be told, there were some voices within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that feared a potential conflict with [GetCountry('JSN').GetName], for they controlled a vast territory and were no strangers to warfare. Their horse archers are especially deadly, with many mercenaries from the steppes riding alongside their levies - certainly no easy target.\n\nBut [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was not convinced of the threat and boldly announced that we would be invading the homelands of our enemies, promising that victory would be ours and that greater glories would be found after we demolished the [GetCountry('JSN').GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] Dynasty.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, everything that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] vowed would come to pass."
 me_jingug_4.a: "In one fell stroke, we have secured vast swathes of territory"

 me_jingug_6_desc: "Now that we have conquered the island of [GetCountry('DMN').GetName], it has been suggested to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that we press eastward, for there are valuable islands that are relatively undefended - the barbarian tribal hordes will pose no threat to our disciplined armies.\n\nIt appears that we shall be using the island of Tamna as a staging point for further invasions."
 me_jingug_6.a: "One by one, the islands shall fall to our forces!"

Once [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] heard this news, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] immediately ordered that our forces prepare for further invasions."
