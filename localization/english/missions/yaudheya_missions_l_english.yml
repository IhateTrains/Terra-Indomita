yaudheya_missions:0 "The Lone Republic"
yaudheya_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The Republic of [GetCountry('YDD').GetName|E], or the Yodheya Gana, was a militant republic centered upon the remnants of the former Kuru Kingdom. Finding itself as the backwaters between two of the largest river valleys in the world, the [GetCountry('YDD').GetAdjective]s exist as the sole republican Janapadas. Yaudheya now exists under the patronage of the Mauryans, who value the Yaudheyans elite military."
yaudheya_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when Yaudheya secures its position as a mighty military republic."
yaudheya_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "The Kshatriya Republic will prevail."

#Missions

yaudheya_missions_task_1:0 "Every Kshatriya a King"
yaudheya_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "The [GetCountry('YDD').GetName|E] were a warrior republic. In the west, we typically view this as an #E Oligrachic Republic#!, however, in Vedic India, the #E Oligarchs#! typically represented the warrior #E Kshatriya#! caste. This was especially the case in [GetCountry('YDD').GetName|E]."

yaudheya_missions_task_2:0 "Trustworthy Warriors"
yaudheya_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "The [GetCountry('MRY').GetName|E] relied extensively on the warriors of [GetCountry('YDD').GetName|E]. In fact, the #E [GetCountry('YDD').GetName] Confederacy#! provided [GetCharacter('(int32)22').GetPraenomen|E] many generals, chiefs, and military victories in his name.\n\n#Y We will send some Yaudheyan Warriors to serve in the Mauryan Army.#!"

yaudheya_missions_task_3:0 "The Three Capitals"
yaudheya_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "We are not just one people. The #E Yaudheyans#! were a group of three states that can be generally centralized into one confederation. The capitals of administration, thus, were centered around three different capital cities or regions. #E Rohtak#!, #E North Panchala#!, and #E North Rajistan#!."

yaudheya_missions_task_4:0 "Rise of Rohtak"
yaudheya_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The largest of the three capitals and the de facto national capital, #E Rohtak#! is the only capital still clearly known about today. #E Rohtak#! remained the de facto capital of the #E Yaudheyans#! until they were eventually integrated into the #E Gupta Empire#! in the #E 1st Century CE#!."

yaudheya_missions_task_5:0 "Hastinapura Homes"
yaudheya_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "#E Hastinapura#! was a major city situated in #E Bahudhanyaka#!, literally translating to 'Corn Country.' This land of corn comprised one of the three administrative republics within the #E [GetCountry('YDD').GetName] Confederacy#!. #E Hastinapura#! itself was the old capital of the #E [GetCulture('kuru').GetName] Kingdom#! which the #E Yaudheyans#! were the successor state to."

yaudheya_missions_task_6:0 "Roaming in Rodewala"
yaudheya_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "#E Rodewala#! is a region that would much later be indentified as a part of #E Northern Rajistan#!, which is where the third administrative republic of the #E Yaudheyans#! lay. This part of the confederacy is very much a countryside, but serves as an important link to west Punjab, a region that would historically come under the control and administration of the #E [GetCountry('YDD').GetName] Republic#! in the #E 2nd century BCE#!."

yaudheya_missions_task_7:0 "Starstruck by Sthanishvara"
yaudheya_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "#E Sthanishvara#! is a growing city of high prevalence. While it has yet to become a capital of any nation, it would eventually come to be the capital of the mighty Empire of Harsha in the #E 6th Century CE.#! Its origins lie in the age of antiquity where it will rise like a star."

yaudheya_missions_task_8:0 "Knock, Knock, Nokhar"
yaudheya_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "#E Nokhar#! would eventually be outshone by a district within it, transforming itself into the mega-city of Lahore. This 'proto-Lahore' remained a relevant city in Porus' Kingdom and is situated right in the center of Punjab. It's integral to hold and grow #E Nokhar#! to assure stability across the Greater Punjab region."

yaudheya_missions_task_9:0 "Marriage with Maurya"
yaudheya_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "While a marriage with the [GetCountry('MRY').GetName|E] never happened historically, close relations with the Yaudheyans was more than common. In order to forge even closer relations with them, we can ask our overlords their hand in marriage... provided the pesky Kingdom of [GetCountry('PRA').GetName|E] has not beat us to it. If they have, then we can still ask, but it is likely our proposal will be shot down."

yaudheya_missions_task_10:0 "Rest of Rodewala"
yaudheya_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "Our relationship with the [GetCountry('MRY').GetName|E] puts us in position to ask them for investments in our country. As we have a city in the area of #E Rodewala#!, the #E Mauryans#! may find our administration in the region worthy of granting us their half of it."

yaudheya_missions_task_11:0 "End the Kingdom of Porus"
yaudheya_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "The time has come for the Kingdom of [GetCountry('PRA').GetName|E] to be put to an end. The tyranny of the sons of [GetCharacter('(int32)498').GetPraenomen|E] has engulfed western Punjab for far too long. It is time to establish Kshatriya republican rule over the so called 'intellectuals' of [GetCountry('PRA').GetName|E]!"

yaudheya_missions_task_12:0 "Smooth Silk from Sakala"
yaudheya_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "The former capital of #E Paurava#!, #E Sakala#! is one of the preeminent cities in not just west Punjab, but in all of the Indus Rivery Valley. While it is indeed known as a center of #E Buddhism#!, it is better known for its gloriously profitable textiles and silk."

yaudheya_missions_task_13:0 "Managing Mallia"
yaudheya_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "#E Mallia#! is not just a city but a whole area. It is incredibly dense in its development, organization, and population. Managing this area requires a gentle touch for it to prosper, but an even gentler touch to make sure they won't revolt."

yaudheya_missions_task_14:0 "Triumph in Taxila"
yaudheya_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "The wonders of the knowledge of #E Taxila#! have come under our posession. While we typically rely on brawn over brain, the University of #E Taxila#! will prove to be the mightiest of exceptions in our growing republic. We should nurture the city to reach new heights!"

yaudheya_missions_task_15:0 "Mallian Marriages"
yaudheya_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "The [GetCulture('sivi').GetName|Y] are well known to us and us to them. It is time we extend them the right to intermarry. This will help us manage our newfound territories and rich cities in #E Mallia#!."

yaudheya_missions_task_16:0 "Dards of Devaprayaga"
yaudheya_missions_task_16_DESC:0 "#E Sthanisvara#! is a great city now, however, its security lies in peril so long as the barberous [GetCulture('dardic').GetName|Y] tribes lay just east of its border. We must declare war for the people against the trecherous Dards all the way to their city of #E Devaprayaga#!."

yaudheya_missions_task_17:0 "Panchanada's Panch Nagara"
yaudheya_missions_task_17_DESC:0 "#E Panchanada#!, later known as Punjab, is the region of our people. The breadbasket of all of India, its intelectuals, warriors, culture, and more give birth to a complex and rich region. However, this also makes it difficult to govern. As a republic, we must recognize this fact and decide how to handle it. Should we sponser the creation of a Panchanagara (Five-Cities) league? Or should we bite the arrow and deal with their pesky revolts."

yaudheya_missions_task_18:0 "Way of the Warrior"
yaudheya_missions_task_18_DESC:0 "The [GetCountry('YDD').GetName|E] Republic is first and formost a republic for the #E Kshatriya#! warrior caste. Let us make sure that it stays that way by adopting laws to ensure the future of our warrior culture."

yaudheya_missions_task_19:0 "Maharaja-Senapati"
yaudheya_missions_task_19_DESC:0 "Meaning 'Great King Commander' was an elected leader of the [GetCountry('YDD').GetName|E] Republic. This chief would also serve as the Mahasenapati (Great Commander of the Army) of the #E Mauryan#! military, showing the great amount of cooperation and reliance the #E Mauryans#! had on the #E Yaudheyans#!. With such a prestigious title, we should be granted more autonomy from the #E Mauryans#!, for we have certainly earned it."

yaudheya_missions_task_20:0 "Fight for Your Rights"
yaudheya_missions_task_20_DESC:0 "The many peoples from the edges of west Punjab in #E Mallia#! to the tips of east Punjab in #E Dardic#! country, people have started clamoring to 'fight for their rights.' Who are we to disagree? If they want rights, they must learn to fight like #E Kshatriya#! warriors first!"
