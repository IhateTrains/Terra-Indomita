thaton_missions:0 "The Hall of the #E Gods#!"
thaton_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mysterious #E Kingdom of Thaton#! is said, in Buddhist lore, to have been founded not long after the birth of Buddha, to a line of #E 59 Theravada Buddhist Kings#!. However, this is not the case of archeological and historical records.\n\nThaton in the Mon tongue of the natives was called as #E Sadhuim#!, which in turn came from the word Sudhammapura, an Indo-Aryan word meaning #E 'Assembly of the Gods.'#! The city-state of Sadhuim was established in at least the 4th century BC and became rich from trade between Sri Lanka. The Kingdom, colloquially called the #E Thaton Kingdom#!, would go on to unite much of the Southern Mons and enter into legend, before being conquered by the #E Kingdom of Pegu#!. In its long legacy from its founding to its ultimate destruction, it left a lasting cultural legacy that remained in the lore of its eventual faith forever.\n\nIn these missions, create the legendary #E Kingdom of Thaton#! by uniting the south, and then go even further beyond historical Thaton ever did. The #E Hall of the Gods#! will truly be a divine state that will define more than the Southern Mon identity!"
thaton_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when the #E Kingdom of Thaton#! has solidified her hegemony over the Mon peoples of Southeast Asia."
