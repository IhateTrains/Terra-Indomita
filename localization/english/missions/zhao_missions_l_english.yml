 zhao_missions_task_1: "Hufu Riding and Archery"
 zhao_missions_task_1_DESC: "[GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetName] once suggested that we not look at the #E Di#! tribesman in #E Loufan#! as backward nuisances, but as a source of inspiration for our military - the wild barbarian must be made of steel to survive in the badlands to the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil1!"

 zhao_missions_task_2_DESC: "Despite all efforts of goodwill, [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName] remains a problem that must be dealt with, one way or the other. Before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] feels comfortable moving forward with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] plans, any opposition at court must be silenced - the actions of [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName] have brought shame upon the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] House. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 zhao_missions_task_3: "Handan Military Camps"
 zhao_missions_task_3_DESC: "We have waged wars against many of our neighbors, but none have been as aggressive or as threatening as [GetCountry('QIN').GetName] and they remain a problem. If we have any hopes of fielding armies large enough to contend with our foes, then we must built military camps and send out the call for recruits. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil2!"

 zhao_missions_task_4: "Northern Frontier"
 zhao_missions_task_4_DESC: "The northern frontier is a dangerous place, where the open steppe soon gives way to harsh deserts that are home to bandit horselords that make life miserable for the civilized peoples of the Earth. We must protect ourselves by constructing adequate fortifications, but this cannot be a simple outpost; it needs to be a beacon of civilization in the region, a place that our soldiers will find worthy of protecting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil9!"

 zhao_missions_task_5: "Barbarian Tribute"
 zhao_missions_task_5_DESC: "To the benefit of all, we currently enjoy decent relationships with [GetCountry('LNH').GetName], [GetCountry('HEZ').GetName]  and [GetCountry('LOF').GetName] - our peoples seem to get along just fine and trade and travel flows openly. But might this relationship be developed? There is much that we could do with these barbarians, after all, and they will have to go along with whatever we decide. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil8!"

 zhao_missions_task_6: "Zhao Idioms"
 zhao_missions_task_6_DESC: "The words and ways of the common people have captivated the hearts and minds of the poets, who have collected some of our traditional sayings and mannerisms and immortalized them in song. People all across the land are now familiar with our so-called #Y Zhao Idioms#!, which they view as a source of folk wisdom that is worthy of praise and emulation - an opinion that we agree with. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil11!"

 zhao_missions_task_7: "Capital of the West"
 zhao_missions_task_7_DESC: "Although the capital was moved to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], there is no reason for us to forget our former home, the second city in all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [GetProvince('(int32)8636').GetName]. We should pour the resources of the state in our second capital - the gods will reward us for our fidelity to promises made long ago. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

 zhao_missions_task_8: "End Zhongshan"
 zhao_missions_task_8_DESC: "It has been decided that the enclave of [GetCountry('ZHS').GetName] has been tolerated long enough, and it is time to put an end to their delusions of independence from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil4!"

 zhao_missions_task_9: "Secure Succession"
 zhao_missions_task_9_DESC: "The time has come for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to do what [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has secretly desired; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has decided to step down from the throne and give the authority to rule over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil8!"

 zhao_missions_task_10_DESC: "The School of Names, a consortium of philosophers who are sometimes dismissed as mere 'Logicians', have produced an exceptional talent in the writer #E Gongsun Long#!, who has attracted attention all throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for his achievements and scholarly endeavors. Let us send for this wise man, to see if he will come serve [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and the people of our nation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil1!"

 zhao_missions_task_11: "Curtail Wei"
 zhao_missions_task_11_DESC: "The armies of [GetCountry('WEI').GetName] have crossed their side of the #E River He#! to seize valuable farmlands that we view as our own. The time has come to silence the yapping of this barking dog and to take what is rightfully ours. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

 zhao_missions_task_12: "Heshibi Incident"
 zhao_missions_task_12_DESC: "What a fool [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has been, to listen to the deceitful words of [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetName], the Lord of the [GetCountry('QIN').GetName]. They have made us an impudent offer that we graciously accepted, but now they claim to have never said such things, implying that we are liars - what an insult to our honor! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil9!"

 zhao_missions_task_13: "Mausoleum of the Kings of Zhao"
 zhao_missions_task_13_DESC: "Let us not forget the House of Ying, who have accomplished great deeds that are worthy of remembering forevermore - we must build an eternal resting place worthy of the noble line of warrior-kings that led our nation through difficult times. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil12!"

 zhao_missions_task_14: "Promote Zao She"
 zhao_missions_task_14_DESC: "One of our most respected countrymen, a bureaucrat named #E Zao She#! that is famed for being an honest Minister of Revenues, has requested permission to lead armies for the banner of [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName], and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is inclined to permit this; Zao is a skilled administrator and has proven his genius time and time again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil10!"

 zhao_missions_task_15: "Han Protectorate"
 zhao_missions_task_15_DESC: "The [GetCountry('HAN').GetName] are a proud people and worthy of the many accolades they have received, and yet is has become clear to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that they would thrive underneath the gentle hands of Zhao overlordship. The time has come to turn this vision into a reality. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"

 zhao_missions_task_16: "Li Mu"
 zhao_missions_task_16_DESC: "We live in an era where legendary generals can be found leading the armies of all of the great powers, and yet #E Li Mu#! stands head and shoulders above any that currently serve [GetCountry('ZHA').GetName]. We should recruit the master immediately! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil8!"

 zhao_missions_task_17: "Lian Po's Defensive Line"
 zhao_missions_task_17_DESC: "One of the greatest generals in the history of warfare, #E Lian Po#!, has proposed that we construct a series of fortifications that will protect us from enemy incursion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@greek_mil1!"

 zhao_missions_task_18: "Xiongnu Threat"
 zhao_missions_task_18_DESC: "We absolutely cannot allow the terrifying [GetCountry('XNU').GetName] barbarians to control the caravan routes that lead into the steppes, for if the horselords have these territories in their possession, they will be able to raid us with impunity - this threat must be dealt with! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil9!"

 zhao_missions_task_19: "Quash Qin"
 zhao_missions_task_19_DESC: "Slowly but surely, the armies of our rival [GetCountry('QIN').GetName] are being pushed back by our advancing forces. The morale of the enemy is lower than it has ever been, and it has become clear to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that the time has come to quash Qin once and for all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil10!"

 zhao_missions_task_20: "Sinus Bohai"
 zhao_missions_task_20_DESC: "The calm and prosperous waters of the #E Sinus Bohai#! will soon see fleets of Zhao warships patrolling the sea. And yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s appetites for coastal territories has only grown, and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has made it known that the rich provinces of the [GetCountry('YAN').GetName] are irresistible to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim]...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

 zhao_missions_task_21_DESC: "Who can dare oppose the will of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who sends the armies of Zhao wherever [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] pleases? Can any force be mustered to keep the mighty Zhao from overrunning the lands of the Jin? We shall chase our enemies even unto the #E Zhongyuan Mountains#! - there shall be no refuge for them anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@tibet_mil4!"

 zhao_missions_task_22: "Great War of Unification"
 zhao_missions_task_22_DESC: "At long last, the moment of victory is tantalizingly close, just barely out of the reach of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s fingers. Let us not delay from achieving immortal glory, but let us destroy the last impediments to the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] claiming all of the Middle Kingdom! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil5!"

 #Events 
 me_zhao_1_title: "$zhao_missions_task_1$"
 me_zhao_1_desc: "When [GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetName] made the unorthodox suggestion to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that our horsemen start wearing the foreign clothing styles of the savage nomads in our northern provinces, there was a great deal of pushback from the conservative elements at court who abhorred the open embrace of such strange behaviors - what would our ancestors think, to see us abandoning [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] ways to dress like herders?\n\nAnd yet once [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had been convinced, there was no going back - our cavalry would adopt Hufu, the apparel of the barbarian. [GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetFirstName] was certain that our military forces would benefit, and the wise Minister was soon proven to be correct. The #E Loufan#! tribes are backwards but they excel as riders, and their clothes are well-suited to maneuvering on horseback.\n\nOur mounted levies are even deadlier than they were before..."
 me_zhao_1.a: "I have faith in your counsel, [GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetName] - well done"

 me_zhao_2_title: "$zhao_missions_task_2$"
 me_zhao_2_desc: "For better or for worse, the ruinous influence of [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName] upon the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] has finally been tamed. The public opposition to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s initiatives were more than an annoyance - they brought shame upon the entire [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] family and cast doubts regarding their fitness to rule over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] during such tumultuous times.\n\nBut in another display of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s deftness at maneuvering through the intrigues at court, the crotchety old Uncle has been silenced, and the opposition at court has fragmented and splintered into irrelevance."
 me_zhao_2.a: "May we never deal with familial intrigues again"

 me_zhao_3_title: "$zhao_missions_task_3$"
 me_zhao_3_desc: "'Press forward and shoot! Is he going to hit the target...yes! Whoo hoo! Excellent riding, chosen ones of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_chinese_huangdi').GetName]!'\n\nWhen the affairs of state do not keep [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] stuck within the Palace at [GetProvince('(int32)8681').GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] can often be found hanging around the conscription camps built on the outskirts of the city, shouting encouragement to the levies that are training in the fields and farmlands outside of the Zhao capital. Every time one of our horsemen hits a target, the cheers of thousands splits the air, followed by Zhao war cries.\n\nThe efforts to tap into the manpower resources of Handan have been a smashing success, and already the armies and levies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are filled with battle-hungry soldiers that are ready to prove their mettle."
 me_zhao_3.a: "Believe me, you will have many opportunities to fight for Zhao..."

 me_zhao_4_title: "$zhao_missions_task_4$"
 me_zhao_4_desc: "Thanks to the efforts of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to spread the light of civilization in the barbarous lands of #E Wuyuan#!, the northern frontier has never been as stable or secure as it is today.\n\nIt appears that the fortress built in the region is strong enough to deter raids from the steppe dogs that like to nip at our borders from time to time, who have fled like the cowards they are deep into their grasslands. In order to prevent them from returning at their ease, we have taken control of important trade routes that they used to terrorize."
 me_zhao_4.a: "The people can put their minds at ease, for I will protect [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"

 me_zhao_5_title: "$zhao_missions_task_5$"
 me_zhao_5_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has finished [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] campaign to dazzle the Tribal Chiefs of [GetCountry('LNH').GetName], [GetCountry('HEZ').GetName]  and [GetCountry('LOF').GetName], who have been brought to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and shown extravagant generosity, the likes of which these barbarians have hardly seen.\n\nUpon arriving at the Zhao capital, they were presented with silk robes and vast quantities of wine, which they eagerly consumed. Horse races and archery displays were provided as entertainment, and by the time that the dancing slaves came out to the sound of the drum and flute, an exquisite feast had been set before the Chiefs that they promptly devoured. There were steaming platters of roasted mutton, pork, beef, braised poultry, fresh and cured fish, racks of smoked sausages, fresh vegetables and those pickled in vinegar, gigantic bowls of steaming rice, and all was accompanied by a fragrant ocean of sauces and hearty gravies - enough of a culinary display to rival even the greatest excesses of the #E Shang Dynasty#!, an overwhelming expression of Zhao largesse.\n\nBy the time that it came to dispense with pleasantries and discuss business, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] found that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] had the barbarians in the palm of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] hand and could take whatever [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] wanted."
 me_zhao_5.a: "You must submit to me as feudatories of mighty Zhao"
 me_zhao_5.b: "Your warriors must fight for me as auxiliaries"

 me_zhao_6_title: "$zhao_missions_task_6$"
 me_zhao_6_desc: "Although our common sayings and expressions are a matter of every-day speech, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has given the order to the scribes living within the palace at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to begin writing down these tidbits of folk wisdom so that all nations might learn from our ways.\n\nThanks to this scholarly effort to catalog our cultural witticisms and expressions, our neighboring states are beginning to use our idioms in their own languages - proof that our culture is one to be emulated."
 me_zhao_6.a: "May our ways be preserved for the generations to come"

 me_zhao_7_title: "$zhao_missions_task_7$"
 me_zhao_7_desc: "Despite what others might say, our people are sentimental, proudly remembering the deeds and glories of the past and remaining faithful to the ancient ways. It is this spirit of duty that has led [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to pour some of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s resources into the city of [GetProvince('(int32)8636').GetName], which was once the seat of our power and could serve as a second capital, a capital of the west."
 me_zhao_7.a: "Jinyang must not wither away, but must bloom on the vine"

 me_zhao_8_title: "$zhao_missions_task_8$"
 me_zhao_8_desc: "As was expected, the meager forces of [GetCountry('ZHS').GetName] crumbled apart like a fish cake, and we have seized everything that was theirs for the greater glory of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]."

 me_zhao_25_desc: "The gods have been kind to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], although the path that they set before him has never been an easy road to travel. Life consists of the usual fare for a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], protector of his people and defender of ancient tradition; occasional regional rebellions, pretenders to the throne pressing ill-advised claims, scandalous intrigues at court...enough to make a man weary, lamenting the heavy weight of the crown upon his brow.\n\nAnd yet things could be worse for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and he knows it; he has a skilled minister that eases his administrative burders in [GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetName], and together, the two men are working together to transform Zhao society. Not everyone is on board with these plans, however; some family members, like [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetName], are opposed to adopting Hufu riding traditions and their manner of clothing. Despite [GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetFirstName]'s efforts to convince [GetCharacter('(int32)633').GetFirstName] to embrace these reforms, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s uncle remains a destabilizing influence at the royal court, a rumbling storm on the horizon.\n\nYet not all is troublesome with family; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s six-year old son [GetCharacter('(int32)630').GetName], the youngest member of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] clan, is inseparable from his father and follows him everywhere; truly, a parent's delight, a gift upon a blessing.\n\nAnd yet, there are many mournful days where the King often daydreams of retiring from his responsibilities at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] altogether..."
