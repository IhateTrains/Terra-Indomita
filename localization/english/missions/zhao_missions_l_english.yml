 zhao_missions_DESCRIPTION: "The last one hundred years have been a whirlwind for our people, who have had a front row seat to the epoch-defining events that have transformed the world around us. Ever since the #E Partition of Jin#!, in which we played an important role, the various principalities and kingdoms surrounding us have struggled to dislodge us from our preeminent position.\n\nChief amongst our rivals are the [GetCountry('QIN').GetName], and although a period of fragile peace exists between our peoples, it will not be long before the ambitions of Kings will send tens of thousands of men to their graves. Will Zhao manage to rise above all others, or will it be destroyed and forgotten like so many other petty kingdoms that strived against the march of history in vain?"

[GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetFirstName] was certain that our military forces would benefit, and the wise Minister was soon proven to be correct. The #E Loufan#! tribes are backwards but they excel as riders, and their clothes are well-suited to maneuvering on horseback.\n\nOur mounted levies are even deadlier than they were before..."

There were steaming platters of roasted mutton, pork, beef, braised poultry, fresh and cured fish, racks of smoked sausages, fresh vegetables and those pickled in vinegar, gigantic bowls of steaming rice, and all was accompanied by a fragrant ocean of sauces and hearty gravies - enough of a culinary display to rival even the greatest excesses of the #E Shang Dynasty#!, an overwhelming expression of Zhao largesse.\n\nBy the time that it came to dispense with pleasantries and discuss business, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] found that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] had the barbarians in the palm of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] hand and could take whatever [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] wanted."

But the simple truth remains that no one is certain of where Wuling's bones rest.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] often ponders the complicated legacy of his predecessor, who introduced Hufu into the land and will be remembered forever for such changes. In the end, it can be said that Yong failed to escape the intrigue and obligation that had weighed upon him, even though he desired freedom from responsibility; sometimes, it is a man's destiny to be a King and it is a duty that ends only with Death.\n\nLessons that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will remember all of his days."

 me_zhao_14_desc: "A few months ago, a strange request was submitted to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], and although the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] was initially tempted to ignore the supplication, after pondering it further, it was granted.\n\nWithin the lands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] there lives a Minister of Revenues, a man named #E She Zhao#!, who has done exceptionally well in his job and has earned a reputation for fairness and genius for numbers.\n\nAnd yet it appears that She desire more than a quiet life adding figures; the mild-mannered mathematician seeks glory on the battlefield and would like to leave the comforts of the libraries at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for a soldier's life at the front.\n\nWhile some advised against allowing this, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was curious to see if excellence in one field would equate to glory in another, and so gave [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] permission. The only negative, from anyone's perspective, was that #E She Zhao#!'s son, a wastrel named #E Kuo Zhao#!, would move to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] capital alongside his father."

After the losses they suffered, there will be no coming back for them...their days are clearly numbered, and the gods of the underworld are gorging themselves on the fallen Han soldiers."

But, if you will forgive an impudent thought, I have to wonder aloud - is your reputation a deserved one? Is it true what they say about you - that you are one of the greatest generals to wield a sword? That you fight for honor and that no man can purchase your services?' Rising to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] feet, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] continues. 'They say that you have slain a thousand men and are responsible for the deaths of ten thousand men, and yet you willingly present yourself to me so that you might fight for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?\n\nStanding before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is a man, dressed in the simple armor of a Zhao warrior.

Instead of allowing them to say their words, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has ordered the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] soldiers to fire arrows at any Xiongnu barbarian that leaves the steppe.\n\nIt is said that the wrath of [GetCountry('XNU').GetRuler.GetName] knows no bounds and that the Tribal Chief has threatened to turn [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s skull into a drinking vessel, but these are the empty threats of a impotent nomad, the indignant barking of a eunuch."

Although the clashes between our people were fierce, the gods were with us and our armies have claimed valuable Qin lands that we shall never return.\n\nChucking grimly, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] drains a goblet of wine and throws the empty vessel to the ground.

Life consists of the usual fare for a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], protector of his people and defender of ancient tradition; occasional regional rebellions, pretenders to the throne pressing ill-advised claims, scandalous intrigues at court...enough to make a man weary, lamenting the heavy weight of the crown upon his brow.\n\nAnd yet things could be worse for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], and he knows it; he has a skilled minister that eases his administrative burders in [GetCharacter('(int32)634').GetName], and together, the two men are working together to transform Zhao society.
