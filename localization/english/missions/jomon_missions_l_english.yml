 ezo_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName|Y] people are split into three clans. The #E Esan#!, the #E Ebetsu#!, and the #E Kitami#!.

#Missions

 ezo_missions_task_1:0 "Horizons of Hokkaido"
 ezo_missions_task_1_DESC:0 "We #Y Ezo#! might live on our island of #E Hokkaido#!, however, beyond our shores lay new opportunities. We should invest some resources in order to evaluate our best avenues of influence beyond our horizons."
 
 ezo_missions_task_2:0 "The Three Tribes"
 ezo_missions_task_2_DESC:0 "#E Hokkaido#! is divided amongst three #Y Ezo#! tribes. The #E Esan#! tribe, the #E Ebetsu#! tribe, and the #E Kitami#! tribe. There is a dream to unite the three tribes, either by force or diplomacy."
 
 ezo_missions_task_3:0 "Proficient Fishing"
 ezo_missions_task_3_DESC:0 "The fishermen of #E Esan#! are experts at their crafts. They war against the sea itself, feasting on a wide variety of fishes. They catch enough to trade the #Y Fish#! with the island of #E Honshu#! to the south."
 
 ezo_missions_task_4:0 "Sap-Stone from Sakhalin"
 ezo_missions_task_4_DESC:0 "The traders of #E Ebetsu#! have guile and charisma equal to none in [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E]. Especially profitable for them is the #Y Amber#! trade with #E Susuya#!, a #E Sakhalin#! tribe."
 
 ezo_missions_task_5:0 "Art of Amber"
 ezo_missions_task_5_DESC:0 "The jewelers of #E Kitami#! are skilled and careful, uniquely able to craft the most  beautiful jewelry out of the #Y Amber#! they buy from the #E Ebetsu#!."
 
 ezo_missions_task_6:0 "Home in Hokkaido"
 ezo_missions_task_6_DESC:0 "Our home in #E Hokkaido#! has become unified under our banner. Our #Y Ezo#! culture  is quite diverse, but now unified, we find much more in common with our fellow #Y Ezo#! tribes then we ever did in our  differences. The future is bright for the #E Jomon#! of #E Hokkaido#! as we look beyond our bays, and to the shores in #E Honshu#!."
 
 ezo_missions_task_7:0 "Siblings in Sunazawa"
 ezo_missions_task_7_DESC:0 "The #E Esan#! tribe was never a purely #Y Ezo#! entity. While over time, the trade within #E Hokkaido#! and the resulting cultural exchange has given us a common identity, the #E Esan#! are much more distant. While the other #Y Ezo#! trade with the #E Susuya#!, the #E Esan#! fish by themselves, selling to the people of #E Tohoku#!. The #E Esan#! identity itself is a mixture of #Y Sunazawa#! and #Y Ezo#! cultures, thus, we should officially accept #Y Sunazawa#! culture as our equals and conquer the land of our siblings in one hybrid nation."
 
 ezo_missions_task_8:0 "Siblings in Susuya"
 ezo_missions_task_8_DESC:0 "While a distinct people, the #Y Susuya#! people of #E Sakhalin#! have been trading with us for centuries. We are linked via trade and a cultural exchange, a relationship we can nurture more by offering them to become our #G exclusive trading colony#!. In return, they will recieve the benefits of our exports to them for a reduced price, allowing them to quickly centralize their nation."
 
 ezo_missions_task_9:0 "Playground of the Gods"
 ezo_missions_task_9_DESC:0 "Kamuy-Mintara, or as the [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] call it, Ahasi-Daki, is the highest peak in all of #E Hokkaido#!. We know it as the playground of the gods. Now that we have claimed all the coastal land in #E Hokkaido#! we should appeal to the people of the playground who continue to raid our lands when instead we should allow them to peacefully settle into our lands."
 
 ezo_missions_task_10:0 "Oshima Shallow Forts"
 ezo_missions_task_10_DESC:0 "The [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName|E] tribe was known for its '#E Hak-Casi#!,' or shallow forts. The trade with the [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] of #E Honshu#! and the [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] was seeded with many skirmishes and unrest in the area, facilitating the need for these #E Hak-Casi#! to protect territorial integrity as well as protect the profits of trade."
 
 ezo_missions_task_11:0 "Ishikari Animal Humor"
 ezo_missions_task_11_DESC:0 "[SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName|E] is home to the #E Humor River#!, called as such for its murkiness, as well as the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName|E] first-person narratives from the point of view of animals. This was religiously fueled, as the faith in this part of #E Hokkaido#! was influenced heavily by the #Y Yzic#!, the faith of the #E Sakhalin#! people."
 
 ezo_missions_task_12:0 "Okhotsk Scallop Farming"
 ezo_missions_task_12_DESC:0 "The birthplace of scallop farming, the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName|E] tribe is situated in the perfect place between the mountains and the sea to make many profits off scallop farming, as well as overall success in the market of fisheries."
 
 ezo_missions_task_13:0 "Gods of the North"
 ezo_missions_task_13_DESC:0 "To the north, our close trading partners in #E Susuya#! believe in their #Y Yzic#! faith. While the many aspects of the faith differ from our own #Y Fuchite#! faith, especially appealing to us is the worship of animals. Perhaps we should consider adopting some #Y Yzic#! traditions."
 
 ezo_missions_task_14:0 "Gods of the South"
 ezo_missions_task_14_DESC:0 "To the south, where the [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] live, they celebrate many gods not so dissimilar to our own. Perhaps our #E Kamuy#! are not so different from their #E Kami#!. We may consider adopting some #Y Kodo#! traditions ourselves."
 
 ezo_missions_task_15:0 "The Enlightened Ezo"
 ezo_missions_task_15_DESC:0 "Under [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName|E] leadership, the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName|Y] have unified under our banner and reached a great new height. While we have much to do if we want this to truly become a #T golden age#!, we should appreciate the great progress we have made thus far. The island of the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetPrimaryCulture.GetName|Y], #E Ezochi#!, is a beacon of hope for all [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people."
