 me_tartessia2_43_desc: "One brisk morning, a Tartessian ship was heading for the port of [GetProvince('(int32)1319').GetName] when a pirate ship approached, waving their banners and asking us to hear their words. Intrigued by this proposal but ever on guard, our sailors slowed down and allowed the pirates to pull up alongside them.\n\nAfter introductions were made, it was clear that these brigands were from [GetProvince('(int32)1318').GetName], where the pirates have openly set up shop, harrassing the shipping that flows in and out of the #E Mare Hibericum#!. At first, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] had toyed with the idea of driving them out of #E Lusitania#!, but ultimately decided to let sleeping dogs lie, having decided there were other priorities for the Tartessian people. But it is clear, to the pirates at least, that this is only a temporary situation.\n\nRealizing that their days are numbered, the pirates have asked to join forces; if we build them a #E Pirate Haven#! in [GetProvince('(int32)1319').GetName], they promise to teach our sailors all of their slaving tricks - a proposition that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] finds irresistible."

Even [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has taken to wearing a #E Lusitanian Fur Cap#! on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] own hunts, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] can often be found in the forests, sitting before a fire as the delicious smells of roasted boar fill the air."

[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], sensing an opportunity, called on the local pirates to build another #E Tartessian Military Harbor#! in the province, and now many ships dock in the #E 'Barbarian's Citadel'#!, as it has become colloquially known."
