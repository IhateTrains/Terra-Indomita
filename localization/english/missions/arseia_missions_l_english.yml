 arseia_01_task_3:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s Dream"
 arseia_01_task_3_DESC:0 "If Arse shall ever stand as a worthy capital for our state, we must invest in its infrastructure. It is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s vision that someday [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] can transform it into a grand center of culture, commerce, and governance, surpassing even the illustrious cities of our wealthy Massalian neighbors."

 arseia_01_task_4:0 "Edetanian Breadbasket"
 arseia_01_task_4_DESC:0 "To ensure the prosperity of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and its people, we must turn the fertile lands of #E Edetania#! into a thriving breadbasket by properly harnessing its rich soil and favorable climate."
