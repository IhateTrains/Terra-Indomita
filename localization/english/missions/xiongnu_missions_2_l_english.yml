#Missions

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_1: "Subjugate Yuezhi"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_1_DESC: "The bane of our existence for centuries - the Yuezhi - must pay for their treachery against the great Chanyu Modun. The time has come, and our hooves are ready, to finally put an end to our greatest rival in the region. The Yuezhi shall be exterminated."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_2: "Luandi Dynasty"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_2_DESC: "The greatness of Modun to forge a steppe empire from such a diverse set peoples across Asia attests to the vitality of the Luandi bloodline. Forever will the descendants of Modun be respected and feared as the progeny of the greatest horselord to have ever lived."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_3: "The Gryphons' Gold"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_3_DESC: "The great mountains on our western border are said to be inhabited by gold-guarding gryphons - in reality they are but another tribal people who hoard the vast welath of the Altai Mountains for themselves. We will show them to be mere mortal men as they submit to the iron and hoof of the Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_4: "Eastern Nomads"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_4_DESC: "The Hu nomads to our east continue to challenge the integrity of our eastern borders, and compete for pasturelands east of the Gobi and Lake Baikal. While they have served as a buffer between our confederation and that of the Donghu, we can no longer afford their antics on our borders."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_5: "Secure Shanma"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_5_DESC: "The crushing defeat of the Yuezhi have left us as the dominant force in the Hexi corridor, but that does not mean the vast trade wealth of the region is totally in our hands. We must fully secure the corridor and the burgeoning Silk Road trade between China and the Tocharians of the Tarim Basin."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_6: "Laoshang"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_6_DESC: "The politics of the steppe necessitate continuous demonstration of power against those who would challenge the rule of the Chanyu, lest our rule be delegitimized. Upstart tribal elites may find it tempting to vye for the position of Chanyu, until we put them in their place."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_7: "Lake Balkash"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_7_DESC: "Just past the Altai to our west lay the great Lake Balkash, around which some of the best pastures and grasslands of the steppe lay waiting for us. Lesser horselords have long squabbled over the region, and it is well out of reach of the great southern empires. The time has come to integrate the region into our ever-growing empire."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_8: "A Golden Horse"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_8_DESC: "Our numerous conquests have brought gold resources under our control. Let us exploit the new mines and fashion a great golden horse to glorify the Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_9: "Doom Donghu"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_9_DESC: "The Donghu have long been our greatest eastern threat - a rival horselord confederation dominated by Mongolic peoples. We must shatter their leadership and integrate the capable warriors of the Hu into our growing steppe empire."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_10: "War on China"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_10_DESC: "Our steppe rivals have been pacified, our resources are overflowing from conquest, and horses have been bred for war. We are finally in a position to show the Middle Kingdom what true terror is."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_11: "Gold Crown for a Chanyu"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_11_DESC: "Our conquests and contact with the Chinese have led to appreciation for finer prestige items at the court of the Chanyu. Let us hire foreign artisans to craft a golden crown to inspire awe and majesty for the numerous subjects of the Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_12: "Central Sanctuary"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_12_DESC: "Longcheng has always been the spiritual heart of the Xiongnu people since before our great conquests. The capital and holiest city of the empire should be venerated as such with sacred dedications and rituals befitting our new-found wealth."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_13: "Enter the Desert"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_13_DESC: "It is not enough to control the Hexi corridor trade, as the statelets and tribesmen around the Taklamakan continue to realize profits that could be ours. Let us gallop into the first of the areas of the desert oases to exact our tribute."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_14: "Yeet Yan"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_14_DESC: "The Yan are the northern-most of the Chinese Warring States, and have been attempting to blend our steppe tactics with Chinese conventional power. We must not allow them to gain the upper hand on our horsemen. Plundering the great city of Ji will be ample incentive for our tribesmen, with the finest women and goods to be claimed by the Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_15: "The Eastern Coast"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_15_DESC: "Beyond the Hu peoples lay the Tungusic-speaking tribes that sit against the great ocean. Their lands are cold forests and tundra ruled by lesser, albeit ferocious, warriors who have not realized the value of their woodlands and mines. It is time to subjugate these fractious peoples and make better use of their resources."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_16: "Chinese Concubine"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_16_DESC: "One price exacted on the Chinese city-builders is the forced marriage of Chinese princesses to the court of the Xiongnu - with the most beautiful serving as concubines of the Chanyu, and the rest being given to nobles across the vast, multi-ethnic tribal confederation. Let us take a beautiful princess from one of our Chinese vassals to serve in the royal palace. "

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_17: "City of the Chanyu"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_17_DESC: "It is time to make Longcheng into a proper city - no longer just a place for tents and pastures, but a metropolis built in the heart of the steppe, blending nomadic themes with Chinese architectural brilliance. The Chanyu shall rule from a seat of radiant glory over our vast lands."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_18: "March Further West"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_18_DESC: "Conquest of the Balkash region has brought us into contact with even more steppe tribes. These horsemen describe vast riches of hitherto unknown empires in lands far to the south and west. Plunder from their recent raids prove the extravagant wealth of these nations, and the Chanyu greatly desires these prestige items. The only problem is that these tribes lay between our armies and the unknown empires, but that can be remedied..."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_19: "Western Taklamakan"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_19_DESC: "The vast riches of Tarim Basin oasis cities are now within our grasp - their desert fortresses will not be able to hold out forever against the might of the Chanyu's hordes of Asia. The plunder of the great cities of the Silk Road will fill the wallets of our tribesmen, and that of the Chanyu."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_20: "Thrust into Jin"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_20_DESC: "Peoples with strange bronze knives and speaking unheard languages lay in a hilly peninsula to the south of out eastern-most holdings. It is time for the Chanyu to bring these strange peoples to their knees, exacting tribute and subjugation on the peoples of this peninsula and acquiring their bronze treasures."

 xiongnu_missions_2_task_21: "From West to East"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_21_DESC: "The greatness of our empire stretches so far from west to east that we can hardly even conceive its borders. We must maintain control over every corner of our empire by ensuring the loyalty of the various governors of the foreign districts."
 
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_22: "The Peninsula of Jin"
 xiongnu_missions_2_task_22_DESC: "There shall be no more indepedent Korea - we must finish the job and conquer the remaining independent states in the region, securing our entire eastern land border against the great ocean."


 #Events
 me_xiongnu_2_1_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_1$"
 me_xiongnu_2_1_desc: "As the Chanyu lay his last arrow into the back of a fleeing Yuezhi horseman, he restrained his excitement. His fellow tribesmen had won the day and were already celebrating, chanting warcries as they finished off their fleeing and injured enemies. There were to be no prisoners. The Chanyu stood in awe at the carnage of the battlefield and pondered what victory over the Yuezhi would mean for the Xiongnu, and what it meant for him personally. Once a captive of this great tribal society, he escaped and now led an army to lay them to utter waste. The Yuezhi fled westward beyond knowledge of the Xiongnu. Visions of future conquest in the lands of the East came upon the Chanyu, and he turned away from the direction of his cheering comrades, away from the fleeing Yuezhi in the west, and began to gallop East. "
 me_xiongnu_2_1.a: "Our greatest rivals are destroyed!"

 me_xiongnu_2_2_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_2$"
 me_xiongnu_2_2_desc: "Even 500 generations from now, tribesmen will harken back to this time, to this great Chanyu. They will claim their legitmacy to rule the steppe based on what Chanyu Modun has done in his life, and claim to be a descendant of this first God of the Steppe. Let the blood of Luandi haunt and terrorize enemies of our descendants throughout the millenia."
 me_xiongnu_2_2.a: "The right to rule is in our blood."

 me_xiongnu_2_3_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_3$"
 me_xiongnu_2_3_desc: "The Chanyu rode into the great Altai Mountains, after speaking to the captured shamans of the Gryphians. He was told a story of Gryffons guarding gold high upon a frozen mountaintop, with offerings and sacrifices performed to appease them just outside the cave. The Chanyu, with his bodyguards, found a horde of gems, bronze swords, bucklers, along with frozen sacrificial victims. This was the place. The Chanyu entered the cave without hesitation, torch in hand. After walking several paces, the Chanyu stopped and gasped. Huge skulls of Gryphons were frozen into the walls of rock and ice in front of him. The torches' light shone brightly on the wall, revealing veins of gold streaking throughout the cave. The Chanyu mumbled something about Tengri and the Great Wolf, and left the cave, forbidding anyone to ever enter again, and commanding offerings and sacrifices at the entrance annually."
 me_xiongnu_2_3.a: "Let us inherit the legacy of the Gryffons."

 me_xiongnu_2_4_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_4$"
 me_xiongnu_2_4_desc: "The first pitiful tribes of the Hu presented no match for the Chanyu and his host. The lands were swiftly integrated into the new tribal order, with flocks of Hu joining our ranks by the thousands. A great ceremony of intermarriage was conducted whereby the women of the Hu were given to the noble clansmen throughout the realm, with the finest reserved for the Chanyu himself. The Hu men would continue to live on their land, produce herds with which to feed the Xiongnu armies, and provide manpower when needed."
 me_xiongnu_2_4.a: "The Hu are no match for us."

 me_xiongnu_2_6_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_6$"
 me_xiongnu_2_6_desc: "Laoshang, an up and coming star among the military and political leadership of our vast empire, dare to challenge our rule! Word has reached our ears that he has the backing of at least some contigent of the army and council. The Chanyu rode forth without delay, eager to silence any critics, and challenge this ambitious upstart to single combat. Laoshang could hear the thundering hooves in the distance and rode forth to meet his lord. As they met, the Chanyu, with his lavish bronze and iron sword, swung deep toward his foe, cleaving his head completely off. The Chanyu's horse was stabbed and fell to the ground, knocking the Great Chanyu to the dirt. When he arose, the entire camp hailed and chanted the name of Modun, putting all pretense of challenge to his rule to bed."
 me_xiongnu_2_6.a: "The other clan leaders will fear and obey."

 me_xiongnu_2_7_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_7$"
 me_xiongnu_2_7_desc: "The tribes along Lake Balhash proved no match for the might of the Xiongnu. Their vast grasslands along the lake now are within the domain of our Chanyu, and yet more clans of the steppe swear fealty to him. These tribesmen interestingly speak of great riches far to the south and west, and even claim that some portions of our old nemesis, the Yuezhi, have fled south of here to seek refuge in these fabled lands. Perhaps it is time for us strike out further..."
 me_xiongnu_2_7.a: "The vast Western Steppe now lay open."

 me_xiongnu_2_8_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_8$"
 me_xiongnu_2_8_desc: "Upon riding back to the royal court at Longcheng after the most recent raids, the Chanyu was struck by a marvelous golden statue, dedicated to his previous horse which had fallen in combat, near the entrance of his great tent, built by the finest artisans brought in from across our vast realm. The Great Chanyu called for a feast and invited all the major constituent tribal elites of the Xiongnu Confederation to his halls, generously gifting portions of his flock to the tribal elite and dedicating offerings at religious temples. The purpose of this was twofold - to show his secure the loyalty the elites with gifts and to inspire awe and majesty in his rule by showcasing the magnificant horse. "
 me_xiongnu_2_8.a: "A gift worthy of the Chanyu!"

 me_xiongnu_2_9_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_9$"
 me_xiongnu_2_9_desc: "The Donghu were but the last remaining major steppe tribal confederation east of the Altai that could possibly challenge our rule. Upon shattering their vast armies in the open field, the confederation dissolved and the consituent tribes one by one declared their allegiance to the Great Chanyu and allowed their lands to be annexed by the Xiongnu. Our new Hu brothers speak of a vast and rich realm directly to the south, providing many samples of luxurious and mysterious goods to our court. The Hu even provided slaves and women from this great kingdom to the Chanyu, whispering of the great plunder the lands of the south hold. From this moment, the Great Chanyu would learn all he could about the tactics culture of these city-builders, and become obsessed with claiming dominion over the Middle Kingdom."
 me_xiongnu_2_9.a: "We have no rivals in the Eastern Steppe."

 me_xiongnu_2_10_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_10$"
 me_xiongnu_2_10_desc: "Our great leader gave a speech after the conquest our latest foes - 'I am not content with the vast grass sea, I am not content with just sheep, cattle and horse. We have seen with our own eyes the silks, the gold, the women, the wine, the entirety of the wealth of those weaker than us. Our pitiful and sparse trade and raids upon their land have produced but small hints at the luxuries that we ought possess. Their elders wear fine clothes, feast every night, fill halls of gold, drink sweet wines to their heart content; while our elders live in cold huts, often in squalor, one raid or one flock from starving. Why should the strong be content to live on the frozen edge of the world while the weak men of civilizations live in warm stone houses and want for nothing? We will ride through their great halls, and give our elders what their have had for generations! We will take their wine, silks, gold and women, and then they will understand what it is like to live a life of hardship!"
 me_xiongnu_2_10.a: "The wealth of China will be ours!"

 me_xiongnu_2_11_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_11$"
 me_xiongnu_2_11_desc: "Yet another golden gift has been contructed by some of the new Chinese artisan-slaves at Longcheng; a fabulous golden crown to be worn atop the Chanyu's head, signifying his royal status among the Chinese and captivating the minds of his fellow tribesmen. Subjects from across the great steppe to the cities of China will kneel before the golden crown of Modun."
 me_xiongnu_2_11.a: "Awe at the majesty of our Great Chanyu!"

 me_xiongnu_2_12_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_12$"
 me_xiongnu_2_12_desc: "The ritual embellishment of the heart and soul of the empire - Longcheng - has led to a new religious fervor overtaking residents of the capital. The tribesmen and craftsmen awe at the contruction of temples, watch daily rites performed with a mystical air about them, and believe they are part of something greater than themselves. The shaman class, meanwhile, could not be happier with their new accomadations and status, entrenching their loyalty to the state. All goes according to plan..."
 me_xiongnu_2_12.a: "Longcheng will forever be our spiritual home."

 me_xiongnu_2_13_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_13$"
 me_xiongnu_2_13_desc: "The dry and hot desert climate of the Taklamakan is not well suited for northern steppe horsemen - we had lost many beloved clansmen to attrition in these sandy desert, many horses have died of thirst, and some among our host had wondered why we had ventured so far for such little gain. Then, on the horizon, a great walled city in the desert, surrounded by trees and water, could be seen. Visions of plunder and glory filled the fantasies of the tribesmen, uplifting their morale. The siege was harsh on the warparty in this first city, however some Chinese engineers were able to teach our men tactics in capturing walled towns. Finally, after the grueling siege, our victorious tribesmen were able to indulge the fantasies that filled their eyes when they first gazed upon the oasis city."
 me_xiongnu_2_13.a: "The Tocharians would be wise to submit."

 me_xiongnu_2_14_title: "$xiongnu_missions_2_task_14$"
 me_xiongnu_2_14_desc: "The commanders of Yan attempted to flee from battle just outside the city gates of Ji, but alas, our horsemen were faster, and cut them down before the gate could even be opened. The entire countryside was burnt, and the city laid to siege. Eventually, the city was betrayed by Hu slavemen within the city, with the promise that non-Chinese residents of the city would be spared. But that was the only thing spared. The city was sacked, with thousands dying and the coffers of the kingdom claimed by the Chanyu, with portions doled out to his warriors. The wealth attained from this city was beyond anything anyone Xiongnu tribesmen had ever seen, yet even richer and larger cities lay further within the Middle Kingdom. The Chanyu was not yet satiated."
