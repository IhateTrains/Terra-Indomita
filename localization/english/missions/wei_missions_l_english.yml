 wei_missions: "A New Wei Forward"
 wei_missions_DESCRIPTION: "Our kingdom was borne out of the #E Partition of Jin#!, and from that pivotal moment, we have been on the back foot ever since. Although our fledgling state was blessed in the beginning with two strong rulers in #E Marquess Wen#! and #E Marquess Wu#!, in the last few years, every time that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has thrown the knucklebones, Wei has come up short.\n\nWe have been stymied in our expansion since the disastrous #E Battle of Maling#! nearly forty years ago, and other nations - particularly [GetCountry('QIN').GetName], whom we once dismissed as a kingdom of wastelands - have become ascendant. If we hope to survive the years to come, then we must find a new way forward."
 wei_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has restored its former lands and prestige, rectfiying the sins of the past."
 wei_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "The road ahead is dangerous, and yet we have no other path..."

 wei_missions_task_2: "Check Chu"
 wei_missions_task_2_DESC: "Many years ago, the armies of [GetCountry('CHU').GetName] dominated the battlefield - truly an opponent that one did not grapple with lightly. However, many years of mismanagement has crippled the southern nation, and corruption is a way of life for our neighbors. Now that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is becoming a force to be reckoned with, the time has come to check Chu. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil5!"

 wei_missions_task_3: "Access Northern Lands"
 wei_missions_task_3_DESC: "The people of [GetCountry('HAN').GetName] have suffered like ours have in the wake of the #E Partition of Jin#! - it is bitter medicine to swallow, watching your former influence and strength dissipating like the morning fog. It has been suggested in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that if we have access to Han, we could potentially persuade them to join with us. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil12!"

 wei_missions_task_4: "Recover from Maling"
 wei_missions_task_4_DESC: "Although the ruinous effects of the aftermath of the #Y Battle of Maling#! has considerably dampened the spirits of our fighting men, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has successfully managed to overcome the effects of this dark episode from our history. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil7!"

 wei_missions_task_5: "Deal with Weii"
 wei_missions_task_5_DESC: "The fact that [GetProvince('(int32)8435').GetName] is not ruled by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] remains a great mystery, prompting our indomitable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] to make official battle plans for dealing with [GetCountry('WII').GetName]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil6!"

 wei_missions_task_6: "Snatch Song"
 wei_missions_task_6_DESC: "The neighboring kingdom of [GetCountry('SNG').GetName] is showing signs of gathering its strength, and, if left unchecked, could potentially become a powerful rival in the region.

 wei_missions_task_7: "Reclaim Western Wei"
 wei_missions_task_7_DESC: "Although the wars over our western claims promise to be bloody, nothing will deter [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] from piecing back together the domains that were stolen from our ancestors. Prepare the levies of Wei for war! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil11!"

 wei_missions_task_9_DESC: "Any of our two traditional capitals, respectively [GetProvince('(int32)8344').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)8446').GetName], would be rich prizes for any of our enemies to snatch - a situation that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed to never let happen.

 wei_missions_task_11_DESC: "[GetCountry('QII').GetName] has become a nuisance lately, and as they attempt to expand their regional control, they can fully expect to meet the armies of Wei blocking their way - we must shove these fools to the ground, forcing them to bow before the might of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil5!"

 wei_missions_task_12: "Destroy Qin"
 wei_missions_task_12_DESC: "At long last, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] feels that our forces are prepared to clash with those of [GetCountry('QIN').GetName]. The rampaging armies of [GetCountry('QIN').GetRuler.GetName] seek to conquer those around them, but they have inadvertently unleashed their own destruction! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil10!"

 wei_missions_task_13: "Push North"
 wei_missions_task_13_DESC: "The cowardly armies of the enemy melt before our forces, throwing down their weapons in their haste to escape the battlefield. Onward, soldiers of Wei! The time has come to push farther north! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@east_steppemil9!"

 wei_missions_task_14_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided to beautify the cities of [GetProvince('(int32)8344').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)8446').GetName] with a grand construction initiative, one that promises to bring contentment to our people and increase the allure of our two capitals. [GetProvince('(int32)8446').GetName] shall be the focus of these efforts, but that does not mean that [GetProvince('(int32)8344').GetName] will not receive its own rewards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@china_mil13!"

 wei_missions_task_19_DESC: "Not only must we conquer the lands of our rivals, but, once encharged with taking care of the cities and settlements that fall into our hands, we must build up the local infrastructure. For what use is possessing a great land unless we do things to improve the lives of the people? We should built harbors up and down the Yellow River, for there is untold wealth to find alongside its riverbanks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@india_mil1!"

 me_wei_1_desc: "'I think I caught one!'\n\nA few moments later, after a mighty struggle against a taut fishing line, a giant catfish plopped into the bottom of the boat, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] let out a triumphant battle cry. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and his lover, the courtier #E Jun Longyang#!, had stolen away together, finding some precious time away from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] out on the river.\n\nMuch to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s surprise, when Jun saw the giant catfish flopping around the bottom of their boat, instead of celebrating with his [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], he burst into tears.\n\n'I fear that one day, your Majesty will find a bigger, better fish, and I will be discarded. Perhaps you will meet a beautiful woman, the wife of a King, and you will forget about Jun Longyang.' Resting his hand tenderly on Jun's cheek, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] drew his lover close to him and murmured a promise."

'The corpses of your soldiers shall feed the crows in the fields and their blood will water next year's harvest - prepare yourself to meet the gods of the underworld!'.\n\nIt seems that [GetCountry('CHU').GetRuler.GetFirstName] does not take our incursion into his lands lightly, but what is the corrupt King going to do besides wail and moan?"
 me_wei_2.a: "Can they match these bold words with action?"

 me_wei_3_title: "$wei_missions_task_3$"
 me_wei_3_desc: "The #E Partition of Jin#! resulted in the creation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], but our lands have never been united into one cohesive whole, but have rather been fragmented into smaller duchies - a problem that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has solved.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] hopes that the people of [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetName] will be amenable to the course of action that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has proposed - will Han open up their border to allow our soldiers through?"

 me_wei_301_title: "Words Of Refusal"
 me_wei_301_desc: "The King of [GetCountry('HAN').GetName], [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetName], has laughed at the request of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], sending an impertinent reply to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s blood boil.\n\n'Why would we give you, a rival for power, access to more of your possessions?

 me_wei_302_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], not only has the kingdom of [GetCountry('HAN').GetName] agreed to give our levies military access, but they have actually requested that they become a #E feudatory#! of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] - an outcome that no one could have foreseen.\n\nThe letter sent by [GetCountry('HAN').GetRuler.GetName] was filled with flowery language, appealing to the vanity of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] by showering [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHim] with compliments."

 me_wei_4_desc: "Although it has been a difficult task - easily the hardest thing that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has ever done - our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has accomplished enough on the international stage to get our neighbors to forget about the #E Battle of Maling#! and what it did to our people's prospects for the future.\n\nThanks to the growing clout and prestige of the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], the citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital] only sing the praises of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] - the weaknesses of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] ancestors have been forgotten."

 me_wei_6_desc: "The unprecedented string of victories won by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] continues, as the rulers of [GetCountry('SNG').GetName] have finally been cast down and forced to submit to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Their rich farmlands and expansive plains now belong to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who exercises ultimate authority against all in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] realm.\n\nSlowly but surely, the holdings of Wei are expanding and solidifying - a sign of good things to come."

 me_wei_7_desc: "Over the last few months, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has slowly been preparing our kingdom for conflicts in the west. It has not been easy, preparing our soldiers and people for the difficult task ahead of us, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has vowed that unless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is able to reclaim our western territories, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will not eat and sleep."

 me_wei_10.a: "Who are your enemies, and how can we help defeat them?"

 me_wei_11_title: "$wei_missions_task_11$"
 me_wei_11_desc: "With our eastern borders secured and the threat of a resurgent [GetCountry('QII').GetName] dealt with, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] finally feels comfortable enough to funnel the resources of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] against the looming threat in the west - [GetCountry('QIN').GetName].\n\nThe days to come will be filled with bloodshed and misery for the common man, and yet the indomitable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] cannot be dissuaded - Qin must be utterly destroyed."

 me_wei_14_desc: "Now that some of our external enemies have been humbled, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has turned [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] attention inward. Some of the greatest signs of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]'s interest in beautifying [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can be found in [GetProvince('(int32)8344').GetName] and [GetProvince('(int32)8446').GetName], the two cities that have repeatedly been the beneficiaries of the royal largesse.\n\nThanks to the investments made at the state level, Daliang has earned a reputation for being a 'beautiful city', which has attracted architects hoping to study the grand designs of the capital."

 me_wei_15_desc: "When the territories of #E Jin#! were split, hacked to pieces as though a butcher had taken a cleaver to the borders, most people living in the Middle Kingdom never could have imagined that a personality would be able to put together what was sundered so long ago.\n\nBut [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is unlike any other ruler that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has ever had; not only has [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] managed to lose the shameful legacy of our past defeats, but the bold [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has restored Jin. The immortal deeds of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] shall go down in the histories as the legendary accomplishments of the Promised One that corrected the mistakes of the past."
