atropatene_mission_01_DESCRIPTION:0 "The reputation of the Median people is known everywhere; our soothsayers and dream-interpreters, the most knowledgeable in the world, are sought after in all of the capitals of the great Empires. Our magnificent ruler Atropates I Atropatid once ruled as a satrap to both the Persians and the Macedonians, but the death of Alexander and the Wars of the Diadochi have given our people a taste of freedom for the first time in many generations. While many hope to subjugate our realm like so many others have before, our people, guided by the Zoroastrian Faith that sustains us, will not quietly submit to foreign authority. No - we have other plans."

colchis_missions_task_02_desc:0 "Built atop vast limestone deposits and on a defensible hilly area at the edge of the plains, Tsikhegoji, known to the Greeks as Archaeopolis, sat at a great crossroads of trade and directly profited from the jewel and precious metal mines found within the mountains overlooking it. Thus, it was both a strategic and presitigous place for a fort - but perhaps we can create a more fitting castle for the one who occupies the Colchian throne."

me_colchis_1_title:0 "The Language of Steppe Trade"
me_colchis_1_desc:0 "During the summer seasons, the pastoral nomads of the northern plains and steppe cross the mountain passes and come down to the port of Dioscurias to trade their wares and services for salt to preserve and flavor their meats. We should send some of our own royal vendors to the port to furnish Kutaisi with the necessities."
me_colchis_1.a:0 "We too shall aquire hard-found salt from this bustling port."
me_colchis_1.b:0 "let us make the Colchian language more permanent in that marketplace."
me_colchis_1.c:0 "Steppe-people fashion metal masterworks. The throne must have some."
me_colchis_1.d:0 "The horse-lords would find better opportunities within our markets instead."

me_colchis_2_title:0 "Salt for the Heniochi"
me_colchis_2_desc:0 "The Greeks at Dioscurias have always styled themselves as better than the Heniochi tribes - both claim to be children of the Dioscuri, but Dioscurias claims the twins' name while the tribal folk simply claim the nickname 'the charioteers.' However, as much as the Greeks despise dealing with the tribesmen, those some pastoral folk are their greatest customers, always buying salt in bundles to flavor their fish, selling cheap furs in return. While the Heniochi are well-known as savages and pirates among the Greeks, sailing in the sleek boats which can be carried over land. However, they are the truest gentlemen when at the Greek stalls, always paying a fair price. \n\nIt is said that the Heniochi once lived as far south as the Phasis and were an offshoot of the Phasioi, whom the Greeks displaced long ago, but now they are confined to their lonely cliffs and small harbors. With this in mind, it was a curious thing when a Dioscurian messenger came running through the halls claiming that the Heniochi had broken all precedent and were assaulting the port of Dioscurias at that very moment. The Greeks have implored us to aid them in destroying the savages."
me_colchis_2.a:0 "We shall use this moment to sieze power and influnce over both."
me_colchis_2.b:0 "Something smells a-foul. Send an armed envoy to negotiate."
me_colchis_2.c:0 "The Heniochi could prove a valuable ally - give them Dioscurias for a favor."
me_colchis_2.d:0 "Let the obnoxious Greeks suffer. Irony is best served at the end of a spear."

me_colchis_3_title:0 "The Magical Plant"
me_colchis_3_desc:0 "A group of specific traders from beyond the Symplegades have been popular within the port of Dioscurias lately. While the riches of minerals, gold, furs, food, and furnishings are often the talk of the town, these peculiar men were beloved for their flowers. \n\nThey strode down the streets and along the riverbeds holding out the puff-shaped, yellow heads with a thick stocks to boot and among their band they kept slaves who had no fear of the blazing sun and its harsh gaze. The soldiers were their greatest customers, and the inns were filled with unusually heavy laughter at night while the morning sickness was never heard nor had in sight. \n\nA local priest of Ghmerti even purchased a bundle of these and, upon passing by, conveyed that the king would do his people a great service if the riverbanks could be filled with these peculiar yellow bulbs all year."
me_colchis_3.a:0 "We will not waste funds on flowers."
me_colchis_3.b:0 "Let's try.....botany."
me_colchis_3.c:0 "The greatest healers, from here and beyond, shall put their minds to it."
me_colchis_3.d:0 "Perhaps my bedchamber would be livelier as well..."

me_colchis_6_title:0 "The Guarded Jewel"
me_colchis_6_desc:0 "The castle stands tall and mighty, bearing down on the merchant wagons and messengers who cross the beaten roads spread out before it. From here, a great deal of the local trade and protection can be administered, and many people of good station have flocked to its ramparts, which are speckled with sparkling stones."
me_colchis_6.a:0 "This protective bulwark will shine!"

me_colchis_7_title:0 "Land of the Pheasants"
me_colchis_7_desc:0 "Thanks to our investments and buildup along the Phasis, there has been a strange and rather hilarious increase in the amount of local pheasants which come down from the thick forest heights to drink from the streams and by the river's side itself. While they are a cute addition to the natural landscape, the small flocks of them are starting to get in the way of people attempting to go about their daily business.\nHow should be deal with this phenomenon before it becomes a larger issue for our farmers and workers?"
me_colchis_7.a:0 "Poultry shall fill the plates of our people."
me_colchis_7.b:0 "Perhaps other lands have a taste for this bird?"
me_colchis_7.c:0 "That sounds like a local problem..."

me_colchis_8_title:0 "Hide Sifting"
me_colchis_8_desc:0 "Our people are accustomed to taking the fluffy hides of sheep and dipping them into the river Phasis. If one is lucky, they may pull out their hide and it will show a color like the sun, having collected flakes of gold. Recently, a farmer, who's name is not known, found some great deposit of golden nuggets and parts in the river. Many have come down from the villages, from the workshops, from the farms, in order to try their own hand in sifting wealth from the river. This development has some in the court worried about civil productivity..."
me_colchis_8.a:0 "Let the people flock to the shores of the river, reap the wealth of their home, and prosper."
me_colchis_8.b:0 "The crown shall control the dredging of the river, for it is the crown's land."

me_colchis_9_title:0 "A Piece of the Past"
me_colchis_9_desc:0 "A lowly wanderer has come into the court with a large grin on their face. In their hands they hold a simple rock, which they present to all present and claim a mythical origin. They say that the rock is one of the same stones which Iason of the Argonauts threw among the warriors he grew from sewn dragon's teeth during his trials in Kolchis - found in the bed of the Phasis itself which the Argonauts sailed in their escape. These rocks, which distracted the warriors, allowed Iason to defeat them, helping him steal the Golden Fleece which the land held sacred. This rock, even if truly a relic of that fight, assisted in the defeat of our legendary leader. How can we hold it in good light?"
me_colchis_9.a:0 "This treasure will serve as an object of curiosity for Greeks everywhere!"
me_colchis_9.b:0 "We shall ritually destroy this rock, denouncing those piratical Argonauts."
me_colchis_9.c:0 "Perhaps the Greeks would buy Iason's legacy..."
me_colchis_9.d:0 "It is just a rock, nothing more. Dismiss this false-speaking daydreamer."

me_colchis_14_title:0 "Guarding Roses"
me_colchis_14_desc:0 "Constuction of the improved fortifications is ongoing, but it has caused a great strain in our resources. This flower of a city has an intensive growing process, and we shall need to invest further into it if it will become a bastion of our people in times of hardship."
me_colchis_14.a:0 "To afford such fortifications, we will have to make the plains of roses profitable."
me_colchis_14.b:0 "More troops defending the wall will need more food."
me_colchis_14.c:0 "We shall quickly take the undefended mountain passes which lead overlook the city."

me_colchis_15_title:0 "Roses Gold"
me_colchis_15_desc:0 "The Rose Mines have been plentiful in their metal ores. Yet, on a rather unpeculiar day, one of the local miners believed he saw a bright glimmer break through the dirt and soot covering all the rocks. Upone checking it, his superior discovered yet another pocket of golden veins running through the hillside. Colchis is truly the land of golden sand! \nHowever, some believe that this deposit would best serve us being outsourced to private miners. A strange man, known as the 'Gold Sniffer,' has arrived to offer his services in exchange for being allowed to privately handle the gold."
me_colchis_15.a:0 "Turn the City of Rose to gold production at once."
me_colchis_15.b:0 "Let those who would exploit our gold deposits come and work for us."
me_colchis_15.b.t:0 "A man called the #Y Gold Sniffer#! will join our nation as a minor character"

me_colchis_16_title:0 "Accidental Flooding"
me_colchis_16_desc:0 "While redirecting the water out of the wetlands region, one of our wooden frameworks snapped and a great rush of water was unleashed on a local village, taking out the supports for many peoples' huts and angering the locals."
me_colchis_16.a:0 "Pay the people for their troubles, and throw in some food."
me_colchis_16.b:0 "We will rebuild the entire village, this time with a proper foundation."
me_colchis_16.c:0 "Gotta break some eggs to make an omlet..."

me_colchis_17_title:0 "The Greek Architect"
me_colchis_17_desc:0 "As we have been planning out the contructiong of a drainage system to finally free the Colchian wetlands of their natural disadvantage, a Greek architect and engineer from the port town of Phasis has come to our court and offered his services as a master-craftsman and designer of odd devices and systems. He claims he could provide insight into how we design our drainage system and would pledge himself to us...for a fee."
me_colchis_17.a:0 "His services could prove valuable."
me_colchis_17.b:0 "Pay him for his designs and then send him away."
me_colchis_17.c:0 "We need not help from the Greeks!"

me_colchis_18_title:0 "New Lands to Reap"
me_colchis_18_desc:0 "As the wetlands begin to drain, arable land has begun to make itself known, revealed from beneath the layer of mud and boggy soil that was once under the waters. It should be our prerogative to begin accessing the lands in a new way and making it finally serve the people of Kolchis! The question remains: How? Where?"
me_colchis_18.a:0 "Let us expand the millet farmlands we have already been tending to."
me_colchis_18.b:0 "Perhaps we should test planting crops in a new area."
me_colchis_18.c:0 "Leave the decision up to the farmers."
me_colchis_18.c.t:0 "The farmers are lazy and do #Y NOTHING#!"

me_colchis_19_title:0 "Our Cut of the Trade"
me_colchis_19_desc:0 "The trade routes reaching far east to the lands of the Indoi and further have brought much wealth to our ports and the markets of the Black Sea. Seeing this, the facilitators and toll booths at our ports have desired to increase the tax levy placed on the transport of goods traveling along the Phasis river. We must decide how to proceed, how to make profit, and how to not stifle such delicious trade."
me_colchis_19.a:0 "Let trade flow free."
me_colchis_19.b:0 "The nobles shall take their cut."
me_colchis_19.c:0 "The merchants shall pay the throne."

me_colchis_20_title:0 "More Languages to Learn"
me_colchis_20_desc:0 "Many new peoples have come to our shores, either through the Pontos Euxinos or from across the Caucasus, but they have, for sure, added yet another layer to our unique cultural mixture. Given how diverse our lands are now, how shall we handle yet new peoples?"
me_colchis_20.a:0 "The people will move where they may."
me_colchis_20.b:0 "The capital will need more translators."
me_colchis_20.c:0 "Telephis is already a place for foreginers - make that its purpose."
me_colchis_20.c.t:0 "The city of #Y Telephis#! will become a #Y League City#! of #E Colchis#!."
me_colchis_20.d:0 "Phasis shall have yet new types of workshops."

In his hands, he held a ram's fleece... so golden, so shining, so glorious in its coloration that it could have only been divine. Yet, there was one patch missing in the display.\n\nGrabbing the strand we aquaired from the Greeks at Phasis, he put it to that same patch, without prompting, and displayed a complete masterpiece - it was as if the strand had vanished, and confirmed that the fleece was genuine. Some belive the gods presented a lone farmer with a golden ram so that another fleece could belong to Kolchis, others believe the old relic had simply made its way back home from Thessalian shores, so the stories and rumors go..."
