 samnium_mission:0 "The Samnites Strike Back" 
 samnium_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Twice have the Romans fought the us Samnites and twice we have lost, yet we shall recover and beat them. Third time's the charm, as they say - especially if we manage to array enough forces against them, for the Etruscans are amenable to an alliance and the Umbrians fear the Romans too. If we manage to create a coalition of the willing, Rome shall fall." 
 samnium_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have beaten our rival Rome." 
 samnium_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "'Roma Aeterna' is an empty claim we shall disprove."

 samnium_mission_2:0 "Fate of Samnium" 
 samnium_mission_2_DESCRIPTION:0 "After defeating the Romans, the Samnites are exposed to the Greek world, a world that entices many a spirit onto a path no virtuous Samnite would ever tread. Yet aren't we defined by our people? If all start to follow that path, maybe we are destined for it? Or maybe to the contrary, we have to extinguish all that is not Samnite in nature. \n\nImportant decisions lie ahead of you and their consequences will be felt the world over." 
 samnium_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have decided a direction for our future. Depending on the choices, this will range from the total conquest of Italy to Hellenizing to such an extent that we are no longer recognizable as a truly italic people with everything inbetween." 
 samnium_mission_2_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Samnium will rise like a phoenix from the ashes of the past, a bird so brilliant it cannot be described by words."

Our diplomats and theirs have traveled the full length of the Italian peninsula to secure support from the many nations who have a stake in the future balance of power here, and we finally have firm promises of support. Our new allies have sent us a war stipend and some of their freemen have settled amongst us. Samnium has a fighting chance - now we wait for the moment."
 samnium_event.2.a:0 "Come, Roman wolf!"

 samnium_event.3.t:0 "$samnium_task_3$"
 samnium_event.3.desc:0 "Our people took severe losses during the last war with Rome, at Tarracina, on the plains of Apulia, and in the years of border raids and skirmishes on the Campanian frontier; but we have sought to recruit new soldiers from the many hard-living herdsmen of our country. They will be hammered into shape within the expanded training camps of our hillforts and urban centers, and outfitted with newly built bronze and iron helmets, cuirasses and weaponry. Our next generation of warriors will be numerous, well-equipped and drilled for battle."

Our armies bring great spoils of gold and silver in their baggage trains. Many of the riches torn from their temples were originally looted from our cities in previous wars and are returning home. Many others were stolen from fellow Sabellic tribes and Etruscan cities over a century of Roman domination. It is now our temples which will display the trophies and our soldiers who will receive gifts of precious coins and heads of cattle and sheep. \n\n It is not just silver which we bring back from Rome. As we sacked their cities and fought their forces, we noted their advancements in civil planning and construction, their elaborate religious and diplomatic customs, and, above all, their martial technique. We can learn from their urban way of life. \n\n Our people are victorious and our coffers are fat."

Their senate has signed an agreement of alliance with us, the sort of alliance in which Samnium will lead and Roman legions will follow. Please welcome the newest feudatory of the Samnite League! \n\n Taking the Romans' nascent empire from them is sure to break their dynamic spirit, perhaps for good, and a measure of autonomy will blunt the edge of their humiliation and garuntee their loyalty.

Our troops have always held the upper hand in our rough and hilly homeland. It was there that we captured an entire legion at the legendary Caudine Forks. Moving at lightning speed across the shepards' paths which crisscross Samnium and bloody raiding into Campania and the Liris valley has been our forte. In setpiece battles against Rome, however, their tactical brilliance has led to defeat and humiliation far more often than victory. \n\n This has changed.

 samnium_task_2:0 "A Search for Allies"
 samnium_task_2_DESC:0 "We need allies against the Roman bastards to our north. Twice already they beat us, and the Etrsucans alone are not enough, we need more allies!"

 samnium_task_3:0 "Preparing for War"
 samnium_task_3_DESC:0 "We need to prepare our troops, for conflict is on the horizon. Many men will be needed to quell the unending thirst of the Roman blade."

 samnium_task_4:0 "Sabotaging our Rivals"
 samnium_task_4_DESC:0 "Nothing hurts an enemy as much as a betrayal and nothing is as effective in bringing down a realm than rot from within. Let us plant the seeds of the Roman downfall."

 samnium_task_5:0 "The Third Samnite War"
 samnium_task_5_DESC:0 "Twice we have faced Rome and twice we have been defeated. A third time now we have to face our rival, for we have prepared against their soldiers and against their rulers. Nothing short of a divine intervention can help those bastards now."

 samnium_task_6:0 "War and Peace"
 samnium_task_6_DESC:0 "For many years wars have dominated our people and many crave peacetime. The harvests need to be taken in and the young ones need to be raised. War cannot exist without peace, and the time for peace has come."

 samnium_task_7:0 "Spoils of War"
 samnium_task_7_DESC:0 "The Romans have plundered many cities far and wide. Having defeated them, it is our right to take those spoils for ourselves."
 
 samnium_task_8:0 "Collaring the Roman Wolf"
 samnium_task_8_DESC:0 "The Roman Wolf is a strong symbol of an effective people and nothing will pacify their citizens under our rule as much as perceived autonomy."

 samnium_task_9:0 "From War We Learn"
 samnium_task_9_DESC:0 "The Roman soldiers taught us painful lessons in the past and we have learned from them. No people shall humiliate us as much as the Romans did in the past."

 samnium_task_10:0 "Dealing with the Socii"
 samnium_task_10_DESC:0 "The Romans had many allies and subjects that fought their wars with them. Now that we have taken Rome, it is time to decide what to do with these accomplices. \nNot all fought for the Romans willingly, pressed into military service by contract, yet others did and profited greatly. We shall decide fairly what to do."
 
 samnium_task_11:0 "Subvert Roman Influece"
 samnium_task_11_DESC:0 "Some Roman socii have been defeated by the Romans in years past, resulting in their current vassalage. Maybe we can incite the flames of rebellion and subvert a tribe, turning them against their current overlord."
