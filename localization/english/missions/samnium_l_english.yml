 samnium_mission:0 "The Samnites Strike Back" 
 samnium_mission_DESCRIPTION:0 "Twice have the Romans fought the us Samnites and twice we have lost, yet we shall recover and beat them. Third time's the charm, as they say - especially if we manage to array enough forces against them, for the Etruscans are amenable to an alliance and the Umbrians fear the Romans too. If we manage to create a coalition of the willing, Rome shall fall." 
 samnium_mission_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have beaten our rival Rome." 
 samnium_mission_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "'Roma Aeterna' is an empty claim we shall disprove."

 samnium_mission_2:0 "Fate of Samnium" 
 samnium_mission_2_DESCRIPTION:0 "After defeating the Romans, the Samnites are exposed to the Greek world, a world that entices many a spirit onto a path no virtuous Samnite would ever tread. Yet aren't we defined by our people? If all start to follow that path, maybe we are destined for it? Or maybe to the contrary, we have to extinguish all that is not Samnite in nature. \n\nImportant decisions lie ahead of you and their consequences will be felt the world over." 
 samnium_mission_2_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be considered complete once we have decided a direction for our future. Depending on the choices, this will range from the total conquest of Italy to Hellenizing to such an extent that we are no longer recognizable as a truly italic people with everything inbetween." 
 samnium_mission_2_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Samnium will rise like a phoenix from the ashes of the past, a bird so brilliant it cannot be described by words."

 # Decisions
 ver_sacrum:0 "Call for a Sacred Spring"
 ver_sacrum_desc:0 "The Ver Sacrum, or Sacred Spring, is most likely a rite originating during the Bronze Age to deal with overpopulation and start a migration of the young. While many cultures once had a similar tradition, only some Italic peoples still celebrate and go through with it to this day. \n\nWhen a sacred spring is called, all the young children ad cattle that are born in the spring of the following year will be 'devoted' to this rite and are considered to be under divine protection. Once they have reached maturity, they will be required to leave their community and are expected to create a new settlement, either by subjugating or exterminating the previous inhabitants or simply by settling uncolonized land. \nSome people think that originally, the 'devoted' children and cattle would be sacrificed.\n\nThe Roman practice of devotio is most likely related to the Ver Sacrum."
