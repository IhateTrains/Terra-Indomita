 zhou_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "The mighty #E Zhou Dynasty#! was once the greatest entity in the world. Spanning back to the #T Age of Bronze#!, the #E Zhou Dynasty#! was founded in 1046 BCE and yet still lives. However, the collapse of central authority is more than apparent. In reality, the surviving state of the #E Zhou#! is naught but a combination of lip service from the #E Qin#!, #E Chu#!, #E Qi#!, #E Wei#!, #E Zhao#!, and #E Yan#!; while actual authority doesn't stretch far from the capital at #E Chengzhou#!.\n\nThe #E Zhou Dynasty#! would be fated to be superceded by the #E Qin#! and then the #E Han#! dynasties, and many Chinese philosophers would point to the decadence and mishandling of the #E Zhou Dynasty#!, praising instead the #E Shang#! and mythical #E Xia#! dynasties. However, where there is an ember, there can be born a flame. And the embers of the dynasty have yet to be extinguished. Can the #E Zhou Dynasty#! reclaim its imperial mantle, or will the #Y Sons of Heaven#! be passed on to the next worthy candidate."

 me_zhou_21_desc:0 "None can deny now that the #E Mandate of Heaven#! has come back into the hands of the #E Zhourites#!. Surely, all thought it impossible. From a single city with no true power to the grandiose empire we see today. It is truly infathomable! We will remember the times of the #E Western Zhou#! as well as the times of the #E Eastern Zhou#!. However, as we usher in a new era of #E Zhou#! dominance, we are fit to remember that all these periods have belonged to our continous state, our great dynasty. A dynasty that has lived since the Age of Bronze. A dynasty that has never been extinguished despite the whole of #E China#! attempting to do just that.\n\nA dynasty that is filled with the sons of heaven itself."

 me_zhou_90_desc:0 "The fall of the #E Western Zhou#! state was in many ways the beginning of the end. In the 8th century BCE, the final king from the #E Western Zhou Dynasty#!, #E King You of Zhou#! replaced his consort with a concubine. The former queen's powerful father would lead a revolt in retaliation, joining with the #E Quanrong#! barbarians, and ultimately sacking the capital and killing #E King You#!. Afterwards, the crown prince #E Yiju#! would be selected as the new king. His new capital was to be #E Chengzhou#!, with the western capital being #E Wangcheng#! and eastern being #E Gong#!. Each city now is decentralized from being formerly united under one #E Zhou#! state. If there is to be a revival of #E Zhou#! dominance, all three capitals must be united."
