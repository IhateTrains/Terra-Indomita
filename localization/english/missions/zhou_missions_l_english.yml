Spanning back to the #T Age of Bronze#!, the #E Zhou Dynasty#! was founded in 1046 BCE and yet still lives. However, the collapse of central authority is more than apparent. In reality, the surviving state of the #E Zhou#! is naught but a combination of lip service from the #E Qin#!, #E Chu#!, #E Qi#!, #E Wei#!, #E Zhao#!, and #E Yan#!; while actual authority doesn't stretch far from the capital at #E Chengzhou#!.\n\nThe #E Zhou Dynasty#! would be fated to be superceded by the #E Qin#! and then the #E Han#! dynasties, and many Chinese philosophers would point to the decadence and mishandling of the #E Zhou Dynasty#!, praising instead the #E Shang#! and mythical #E Xia#! dynasties. However, where there is an ember, there can be born a flame. And the embers of the dynasty have yet to be extinguished. Can the #E Zhou Dynasty#! reclaim its imperial mantle, or will the #Y Sons of Heaven#! be passed on to the next worthy candidate."
