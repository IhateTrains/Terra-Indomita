01_fugandulu_DESCRIPTION: "The settled tribes of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] live on the outskirts of the swamps in the southern reaches of the #E Irrawaddy Valley#! in the #E Pyu#! province, where they faithfully attend to the worship of the ethereal #E Nats#! - a rarity in this part of the world, which has seen both the #E Vedic#! and #E Bon#! faiths spread in lands that were once traditionally Natic.\n\nNo one has managed to unite the regional Tribal Chieftains in our corner of the world, but the growing power of our neighbors remains a dangerous threat that must be stopped before it is too late for us. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed to conquer the region for the Mon, expel the foreign faiths and restore the homes of the Nats, and bring stability to the floodplains and jungles of our homelands."
