These began their mission on the day of Pentecost, around A.D. 30, which day is regarded, accordingly, as the birthday of the Christian Church. Beginning as an obscure sect of Judaism, the chosen leaders among the followers of Jesus, called the Apostles, travelled throughout the world to spread the 'Good News' that their founder, whom they hailed as the prophesied Messiah or Christ ('the anointed one'), is the Son of the only God and had resurrected from the dead to show his power, promising that he would some day return in glory to judge all human souls according to their deeds.
