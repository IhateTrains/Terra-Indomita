 japan_startup_desc:0 "The island of [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] was once home to many tribes of [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people. However, since the later parts of the #E Jomon Jidai#!, the incoming [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people coming from [GetProvince('(int32)9285').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E], began outpopulating, outproducing, and outbuilding the [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y].\n\nNow, the next step in [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] development is upon us, the #E Yayoi Jidai#!. The bickering [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] tribes will begin to centralize into formal kingdoms. One such tribe would grow to become synonymous with all [GetCulture('wa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] people. Its dynasty would last for thousands of years, it would fight countless wars, and it would come to define what it means to be #E Japanese#!. Right now, however, the tribe and blood of [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] has yet to take its first steps towards this impressive legacy.\n\nThe [GetCulture('dewa').GetCultureGroup.GetName|Y] tribes remaining in [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E], called the #E Epi-Jomon#!, are entrenched in the north of the island, and the [GetCulture('duuchuu').GetName|Y] to the islands of south of #E Kumaso#!. They will not be so willing to give up the rest of their autonomy over their ancestral homeland. Instead, they may look to reclaim their land and usher in a new #E Epi-Jomon Jidai#!. Meanwhile, the [GetCulture('wa').GetName|Y] tribes surrounding [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetName|E], as well as the further [GetCulture('kumaso').GetName|Y] and [GetCulture('aduma').GetName|Y] tribes remain a threat to [GetProvince('(int32)9328').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] supremacy. They would happily divert fate and write their own legacies into the history books.\n\nThe fate of the #E #R Land of the Rising Sun#!#! has yet to be decided. Who will be the one to conquer the #E Yayoi Jidai?#!"

 mon_kingdoms_title:0 "The Mon Kingdoms"
 mon_kingdoms_desc:0 "The [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] people are a large group of people who inhabit the coasts of southeast asia. Heavily influenced by trade with highly civilized and rich neighboring cultures, some of the [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] of [GetProvince('(int32)9797').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] and [GetProvince('(int32)9815').GetArea.GetRegion.GetName|E] would develop into powerful trade kingdoms in their own right.\n\nIn the west, the Kingdom of [GetCountry('PEG')GetName|E], established in their namesake capital of [GetProvince('(int32)9800').GetName|E], would blossom at the mouth of the #E Irrawaddy#!. They would eventually be the home to the greatest heights of civilization in the area. Just east lay the city of [GetProvince('(int32)9797').GetName|E] and her Kingdom of [GetCountry('THT')GetName|E], which would go on to unite the southern [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] people and establish itself into legend and lore for eternity as the first successful [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] kingdom. And finally, the Kingdom of [GetCountry('SHE')GetName|E], whose capital of [GetProvince('(int32)9815').GetName|E] would eventually be considered the golden cradle of #E Buddhism#!, and whose populace would someday birth the dominant #E Dvaravati#! culture, would flourish at meeting of mountains and rivers.\n\nThese three kingdoms would all go on to convert to #E Mahayana Buddhism#! and leave a lasting cultural legacy on both the [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] and the people who would come to live there in the far future. The legends of the three [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] kingdoms would start in this ancient period. Drive the fate of the [GetCulture('mon').GetName|Y] cultural legacy into the annals of history!"
