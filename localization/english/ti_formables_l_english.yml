form_hunnic_empire_desc:0 "Defeated and outcast, our people are forced to migrate westward across the steppe in search of a new beginning, fighting off those in our way as we march ever-closer towards the edge of the known world. However, after reaching the end of the endless fields of grass which comprise the steppe, we have encountered a strange world full of rich, fertile farmland and civilizations ripe for plunder and conquest, guarded only by petty tribes and crumbling empires. With our greatest warriors mounted on horseback, we shall swarm through these undefended cities like a ravenous plague and crush any pathetic attempt at resistance we may encounter. From the ruin of our enemies, we will forge a new empire to dominate the western world."
